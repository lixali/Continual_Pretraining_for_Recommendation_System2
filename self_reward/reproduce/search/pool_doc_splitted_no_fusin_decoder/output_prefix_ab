They have all left a mark by being legendary beat makers and story tellers. Now I am not talking about Rap music, I am talking about Hip Hop music. See, I do not consider them the same thing. Rap is all about the money and who has the biggest group of friends or best cars. There is no passion or, dare I say, talent involved in that style of music. Hip Hop speaks to you and takes you into the artists deepest fears and thoughts. Now I want to let you know right now, I am a huge Hip Hop fiend and I may display a small amount of bias towards this subject. That being said, you are reading this so chances are you enjoy it as well. So let me introduce you to Jazz Spastiks\nI have searched for a while trying to find some information on this group of \u201cUnderground hip hop beat makers, djs and producers\u201d. That is their words, and in fact really the only words I could find from them. I could find that they are a group from the UK though, so it has a very real sound. A sound that a live band could make and none of this twisted MIDI and Synth stuff. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, that style of music has its place, but it is not here and Jazz Spastiks makes what they do feel so organic and home grown that you just can\u2019t help but nod your head to the beat.\nTake a listen for yourself and you can thank me later.\n[bandcamp width=100% height=120 album=3107000700 size=large bgcol=ffffff linkcol=0687f5 tracklist=false artwork=small]", "probabilities": 0.014365729875862598}

But strawberries from the market are expensive because grocers hike up the price to cover overhead and shipping charges. To avoid costly price markups and enjoy fresh strawberries at home, grow your own in a strawberry plant holder.\nStrawberry Growth Habits\nStrawberries produce \"runners,\" which are long, thin shoots with satellite plants. The runners tend to create a mounding effect, which requires a lot of room for each plant to develop properly. Strawberry plants grown directly in the garden, are spaced 18 to 30 inches apart to give ample room to each plant. Those grown in containers, require separate openings or pockets for each individual plant to avoid crowding.\nA hanging basket provides an above-ground home for a single strawberry plant. Strawberry plants that grow in hanging baskets produce runners that hang out and over the sides of the hanging basket. Any type of hanging pot or basket suffices, although most strawberry hanging basket kits include a wire frame basket with coconut fiber liners.\nClay artisans create terra cotta flower pots with one top opening and several pocket-like openings in the side of the container. These containers are known as \"strawberry pots.\" This type of container provides room for each of the plants to grow and cascade.\nDIY Strawberry Pot\nIf you don't have access to or funds for a strawberry pot, make your own out of an empty barrel or other large container. A drill with a large boring bit creates holes in the containers side that serve as pockets for individual plants. Do not use containers made out of treated wood or wood composite, as these contain toxins that contaminate food.\nUpside Down Hanging Strawberry Containers\nUpside down strawberry plant holders are a hybrid of a hanging basket and a strawberry pot. The upside down strawberry plant holder hangs above the ground, but has openings in which strawberry plants are planted. These hanging containers are typically made of a heavy-duty fabric that lasts two or three seasons.", "probabilities": 0.013095739297568798}

At 210mm long and 32mm wide, and weighing 1,700g, it brings both authority and precision to larger work.\nTypical shoulder planes are awkward to handle and control; Veritas have overcome this by shaping a new lever cap that fits properly in the palm, incorporating a Bubinga lever cap knob that pivots 180\u00b0 and adding a multi-positional front knob that can be mounted on the top or on either side.\nYou can also grip the plane in the recesses cast into the side.

{"id": "<urn:uuid:34f984f9-d2f9-414b-8201-dc6b30a30e31>", "text": "Strengthening the Eyes\nby Bernarr A. MacFadden, Strengthening the Eyes; A System of Scientific Eye Training.\nNOTHING could be more evident than the fact that exercise of the eyes will strengthen these organs just as exercise of any other part of the body will strengthen that part.\nExercise of any group of muscles not only tends directly to strengthen those muscles, but it so improves the circulation as to improve the condition of the adjacent parts. If any part of the body is weak, flabby, ineffective, exercises which involve the use of the muscles in that region will have a strengthening and toning-up effect. This applies with special force to exercises for the muscles of the eye.\nMost persons will be surprised, perhaps even amazed, at the improvement in the condition of the eyes, resulting from two or three weeks of proper exercise of the eye muscles. This does not mean that one should keep up this work for only two or three weeks. If you will make it a daily practice you can expect to enjoy strong eyes and good vision to perhaps the end of life.\nYou will find that these exercises are very simple indeed. You should practice them not once a day, but a number of times each day. You can practice them while dressing in the morning, while undressing in the evening, while out on your walks, while sitting in the car, or even while taking your meals. But you should set aside some particular time for this special purpose, whether it be morning or evening, else they are more than likely to be crowded out. At this time you should follow the eye exercises by a little of the massage treatment described in Chapter XVII, and in the end use the eye bath, described in Chapter XVIII.\nExercise 1.\u2014Turn and stretch the eyes far to the left.\nExercise 1 (Continued).\u2014Then turn and stretch them far to the right, continuing the movement back and forth from left to right ten times or more.\nExercise 2.\u2014Turn the eyes upward, that is to say, look as far upward as possible without raising the head.\nExercise 2 (Continued).\u2014Then, without moving the head, lower the eyes, looking as far down as possible. Continue raising and lowering the eyes ten times or more.\nExercise 3.\u2014Raising the eyes, look upward obliquely to the left.\nExercise 3 (Continued).\u2014Then lower them obliquely to the other side, looking downward toward the right. Repeat ten times or more.\nExercise 4.\u2014Raise the eyes upward obliquely to the right.\nExercise 4 (Continued).\u2014Then stretch them obliquely downward to the left. Continue back and forth ten times or more.\nExercise 5.\u2014Roll the eyes around in a circle, to the left upward, to the right downward, so on around. Then reverse, rolling them the other way around. Continue until slightly tired.\nExercise 6.\u2014Shut the eyes tightly and vigorously, squeezing the eyelids together as firmly as possible. Open and repeat ten times or more.\nExercise 7.\u2014This is an exercise that should be performed without strain, and at first with only two to four repetitions at a time. Simply look cross-eyed as though trying to see the bridge of the nose with both eyes at once.\nOne of the most vigorous of eye exercises, and one extremely effective for gaining voluntary control of the muscles of the eyes, is the practice of looking cross-eyed. A great many persons will naturally shrink from the thought of such an exercise from the fear that it may produce a permanent condition of strabismus.\nThe fact is that the ability to look cross-eyed voluntarily indicates a good muscular condition and good control of the muscles concerned, and a person with a tendency to involuntary squint will find the practice one of the best ways in the world to correct that condition.\nEye Exercise Diagram No. 1.\u2014 (Explanation in text.)\nAnother very simple method of exercising the eyes will be found in a system of following lines drawn within a large circle, or an imaginary system of lines based upon any diagram, such as those illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Suppose that the circle represents the completerange of vision attained by rolling the eyes around. Imagine, then, that this circle occupies the space on the wall of the room, in front of you, that you can see by rolling your eyes around. Then imagine a series of lines or a continuous line running from side to side, as in Eye Exercise Diagram No. 1, from the top of the circle to the bottom. Now, starting at the top, follow on the wall with your eyes just such an imaginary scheme of lines as that in the diagram. Practice this a few moments with one eye first, then with the other, finally with both eyes together, and then go on to the exercise suggested in Diagram Mo. 2. In Diagram No. 3 the eye starts in the center, then traces out a circular, or to be more exact, an imaginary spiral line, until the circling of the entire range of vision is attained. The head must not be moved.\nEye Exercise Diagram No. 2.\u2014 (Explanation in text.)\nEye Exercise Diagram No. 3.\u2014 (Explanation in text.)\nIf you follow the eye exercises offered in the photographic illustrations there will be no need of adding these imaginary line-tracing exercises. But you may find them interesting as a change.\n|Eyes carePhysicianBate's booksTechnologyForumLaser corre.Blues under eyesburning in the eyesanother diseasesMedical mistery|\nNaturally eyesight correction.

Each year, we see pollination problems with vine crop fruits, especially when weather conditions are unfavorable.\nSigns of incomplete pollination in cucurbits include bottlenecked fruit or fruit with a pinched end, crooked or lopsided fruit, fruit small in size or nub-like; and fruits with prominent lobes or that are triangular in shape. Causes of incomplete pollination may be inadequate pollen transfer by pollinating insects; inadequate pollen sources (pollenizers); or hot, dry weather that reduces pollen viability or that desiccates flower parts during pollination. Research has shown that a minimum of 1,000 grains of pollen are required to be distributed over the three lobes of the stigma of the female flower of a watermelon to produce a uniformly shaped fruit.\nHollow cavities in fruit and vacant seed cavities are related to lack of seed formation, again traced back to poor pollination.
