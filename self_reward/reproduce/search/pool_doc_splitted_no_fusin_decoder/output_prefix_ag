The menopause kicks in and our hormones go haywire. Our skin thins, dries out, looks less toned and plump, whilst our wrinkles begin to form furrows. It's all down to slower cell renewal: a mid-life milestone caused by lower collagen and elastin levels. The result? Our epidermis sags, wrinkles deepen, laughter lines appear and liver spots crop up.In other words, the skincare routines we followed during our 30's and 40's need to be stepped up a notch. We must help our skin to hydrate itself, reinforce its hydrolipidic film, boost cell renewal and stimulate collagen production. So time for preemptive strikes that will both repair our skin and deal with signs of ageing.\nBy the time we're 65, visible signs of ageing have dug in their heels. Unfortunately, our skin will continue to age: sagging, drooping, furrows beside our noses and under our eyes, lines around our mouths... Our skin texture also changes: it thins and dries, becoming more fragile and less plump. Our rosy cheeks are replaced by a paler, more transparent complexion.; Our skin needs different treatments from those that we used during our 50's. Older skin has a hard time dealing with dehydration, so moisturising is key if we want to keep it supple and comfortable. We should also repair our skin (particularly overnight) and pump it full of fortifying calcium-based treatments. Finally, we need to give our circulation a boost so that we can get back our radiant glow.\nGlobal action anti-ageing treatments are a godsend when it comes to improving skin density, suppleness and dealing with a dull complexion. These treatments nourish dry/dehydrated skin, stimulate collagen production and cell renewal, whilst plumping up our features. They're generally richer than anti-wrinkle creams. Packed with lipids, they deeply nourish our skin and quench its thirst. Specially designed for mature skin, they give us back the healthy glow of our youth!

As a good amateur tennis player and a lover of the game, I've seen many amateurs struggle to hit the ball well. Most players have poor footwork, poor preparation and they frequently hit the ball \"late\". Instead of assertively striding into the ball and catching it early, they wait a fraction of a second too late . . . and then awkwardly compensate, fighting to get the ball back. So the players adopt different styles of compensating and learn to get the ball back one way or another. So they practice and hone fundamentally flawed strokes, some even playing really well, but their games are limited in growth potential because they don't know how to step into the ball and hit it early.\n This lack of footwork and timing robs the player of power. When a well-coached tennis player \"steps into the ball\", power is derived from a kinetic chain that starts with the back foot. Imagine a baseball pitcher on a mound, striding toward homeplate, his back foot pushing off from the pitching rubber. Without the additional thrust from his back foot, the pitcher would be an extremely weak pitcher. Or consider the classic image of a batter who's just jacked a homer and then visualize his back foot, where he's firmly stepped into the ball. The batter would be an extremely weak batter if he didn't step into the hit. But so it is with many tennis players. Instead of a stroke that involves the whole body, many tennis players simply swing their arms, pivoting at their shoulder, without stepping into the ball, which forces them to compensate by swinging faster. Faster swings have less margin of error, and thus more errors occur. Fast swings also contribute to `tennis elbow` or other stress disorders of the shoulder, arm and hand. If tennis players could be taught how to step into the ball, they wouldn't have to swing as hard. They would get much of the power needed to return the ball from their legs and hips, thus they could swing slower and have more precise strokes.\n Hitting the ball late also makes it hard to hit with topspin. If a player can learn to step into the ball and hit it early, a natural topspin stroke can evolve easily. When a player is stepping into the ball and catching it early, the contact point is out in front of them. Because the racket arm functions much like a pendulum, if you're hitting the ball early, the racket head will be naturally pulled up near the point of contact, thus creating topspin.\n Ball machine prior art: Most commercially successful tennis ball machines shoot the ball at the player. For example consider patent U.S. Pat. No. 4,841,945 by a great tennis mind, Vic Braden. But with these `shooter` ball machines, there are lots of players out there practicing hitting the ball late.\n As I reflected on the problem, I felt there was a need for a device that would drop the ball consistently in the same spot, so the aspiring tennis player would know precisely where the ball was going to be and learn to adjust to that. After ruminating on this problem for a number of years, I conceived a simple, elegant solution.\n A search of prior art found multiple machines that are `droppers` (i.e., they drop a tennis ball so it bounces to the same spot predictably). But invariably, these machines are complex solutions to a simple problem. U.S. Pat. No. 6,283,876 is a ball dropper that has \"no horizontal velocity\". U.S. Pat. No. 4,021,036 is another ball dropper with a hopper and a \"ball projection mechanism\" at the end of a \"hollow extension arm\". U.S. patent Ser. No. 11/557,470 is another ball dropper with a hopper. The complexity of these machines adds cost and weight, which might explain their lack of market penetration. (I'd never seen these on the market before the search for prior art.)\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n In this invention, a roughly 2' section of 3'' PVC pipe is cut lengthwise into a halfpipe or chute. The chute is screwed atop a wood mounting block. The block has a countersunk 1/4''-20 nut centered at the bottom to allow for mounting on a standard camera tripod. The tennis student mounts the TennisChute on the tripod, adjusts the `tilt` on the tripod such that there is a slight incline, orients the chute to drop the ball \"sideways\" and then is ready to practice. The learning player drops the ball into the high end of the chute, then `tracks the ball` (practicing footwork) as it rolls down the incline and then adjusts to the ball and then hits the ball once it drops and bounces.\n Since the ball drops to the same spot every time, a coach can watch the player and provide direction on how to better adjust to the ball and refine stroke mechanics under controlled conditions; so unlike a `shooter` ball machine, the ball cannot `get behind` the player. The TennisChute has an advantage over previous ball `droppers` in that it is very lightweight, simpler and thus more affordable and portable.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWING\n A single drawing is included that shows a chute 1 (a roughly 2' section of 3'' PVC cut lengthwise into a halfpipe). Chute 1 is screwed into a mounting block 2 (a roughly 4'' by 2'' by 1'' chunk of wood). Centered and countersunk on the bottom of the mounting block is a serrated flange 1/4''-20 nut 3, suitable for mounting the TennisChute on a standard camera tripod.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n In order to make the invention, first cut some 3'' PVC (or other strong and light cylindrical material) to a roughly 2' to 3' length, then cut it in half lengthwise to create a chute 1. To make a mounting block 2, cut a chunk of wood or similar material into a small block approximately 1'' thick and 4'' long and 2'' wide. Bore a 5/8'' hole to a depth of 0.3'' in the center of the bottom of the mounting block, to allow for the countersinking of the 1/4''-20 serrated flange nut 3. Nut 3 should then be glued or otherwise permanently affixed into the countersink hole. Then chute 1 can be screwed into the mounting block 2 using crossdrive flathead screws so that when countersunk, their presence won't disturb the path of a ball rolling down the chute.\n In order to use the invention, the player should mount the TennisChute on a standard camera tripod and then set the tilt on the tripod to create a slight incline of the chute. It is suggested that until the player knows how to `step into the ball` properly, that the chute be initially oriented \"sideways\". Normally in tennis, the ball is hit back and forth. Because the ball is normally traveling toward the player, if the player waits too late, they miss the chance to step into the ball. If the ball is traveling sideways, the ball cannot get behind them. The player can be coached to set their back foot at an appropriate depth (say 3' behind and 3' to the side of the contact point, depending on the player's height). With the back foot set deep, the player has to `step in` to hit.\n The player needs to be taught the best grip to use for hitting the ball in front of them. An \"eastern forehand\" and an \"eastern backhand\" grip are good for hitting the ball in front of them and stepping into the ball. Many players use a \"continental\" or \"hammer\" grip. This grip is not suitable for hitting the ball early. The angle of the racket face virtually forces you to hit the ball late if you use the hammer grip. If you hit the ball early with a \"hammer\" grip, the racket face will be too open and the ball will most likely fly high and long.\n Using the TennisChute, it is fairly simple to teach a fundamentally sound topspin stroke, where the whole body is involved in the stroke. The player gains power from good footwork. By catching the ball early, a natural topspin evolves because at the end of the stroke, the player's arm is pulled up. This topspin allows the player to hit the ball harder and the aerodynamics push the ball down to keep it in the court, a la Rafael Nadal. With the power from good footwork, the player also gains control because the player can swing slower and still hit the ball solidly. A slower swing speed translates to more consistent results. Once a player has developed consistency and control at a slow speed, racket speed can then be added.\n The advantages of the invention include a simple design, low cost and a very low weight and thus portability. The player merely carries a standard tripod and the TennisChute to the court and in minutes, the player can be working on footwork and form for an extremely low cost. Also, since the ball is moving at the slowest possible pace, the challenge of learning to hit well is made as simple as possible. Another advantage is that the TennisChute can be used to practice half-volleys (where the player hits the ball immediately after it bounces). The coach can instruct the player to stand near the bounce point and then precisely feed balls and instruct the player how to `pick the ball up` from the bounce.\n Alternative Embodiments:\n The invention could be made with a different diameter chute in order to accommodate different size sports balls. The chute could also be permanently affixed to a tripod that had a tiltable and pannable head instead of using a standard camera tripod.\nPatent applications in class For game using field or court having dividing means thereon for separating opponents (e.g., for tennis, volleyball, table tennis, etc.)\nPatent applications in all subclasses For game using field or court having dividing means thereon for separating opponents (e.g., for tennis, volleyball, table tennis, etc.)", "probabilities": 0.004036091733723879}

{"id": "<urn:uuid:e24c0dff-c8c0-4825-acd7-97b99a348e90>", "text": "How to Draw a Straight Line\nCornell university's Reuleaux kinematic model collection includes many linkages; the most popular of these among mathematicians is the Peaucellier-Lipkin linkage S35. This article is a short introduction (not complete) to the history of the problem of how to change circular motion into straight-line motion and vice versa. Some mathematicians formulated this problem as: \"How can you draw a straight line?\" The peaucellier-Lipkin linkage was the first precise solution to this problem.\nWhen using a compass to draw a circle, we are not starting with a model of a circle; instead we are using a fundamental property of circles that the points on a circle are at a fixed distance from its center, which is Euclid's definition of a circle. Is there a tool (serving the role of a compass) that will draw a straight line? If, in this case, we want to use Euclid's definition: \"A straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself\" it will not be of much help. One can say, \"We can use a straightedge for constructing a straight line!\" Well, how do you know that your straightedge is straight? How can you check that something is straight? What does \"straight\" mean? Think about it!\nAs we can see in some 13th-century drawings of a sawmill (at right), mechanisms for changing circular motion to straight-line motion were in use in the 13th-century and probably originated much earlier. In 1588 Agostino Ramelli published his book on machines where linkages were widely used. But, of course, there is a vast difference between the linkages of Ramelli and those of James Watt (1736-1819), a pioneer of the improved steam engine and a highly gifted designer of mechanisms. Watt's partner, machine builder, Matthew Boulton, built engines in his shop \"...with as great a difference of accuracy as there is between the blacksmith and the mathematical instrument maker.\" [Fergusson 1962]\nIt took Watt several years to design a straight-line linkage that would change straight-line motion into circular motion. He wrote to Boulton:\n\"I have got a glimpse of a method of causing the piston-rod to move up and down perpendicularly, by only fixing it to a piece of iron upon the beam, without chains, or perpendicular guides, or untowardly frictions, archheads, or other pieces of clumsiness\u2026. I have only tried it in a slight model yet, so cannot build upon it, though I think it a very probable thing to succeed, and one of the most ingenious simple pieces of mechanisms I have contrived\u2026\". [Fergusson 1962]\nYears later Watt told his son: \"Though I am not over anxious after fame, yet I am more proud of the parallel motion than of any other mechanical invention I have ever made.\" [Fergusson 1962]\n\"Parallel motion\" is a name Watt used for his linkage (see model S24), which was included in an extensive patent of 1784. Watt's linkage was a good solution to the practical problem. But this solution did not satisfy mathematicians who knew that it only traced an approximate straight line. An exact straight-line linkage in the plane was not known until 1864. In 1853 Pierre-Frederic Sarrus (1798-1861), a French professor of mathematics at Strassbourg, devised an accordion-like spatial linkage that traced exact straight line but it still was not a solution of the planar problem.\nThere were several attempts to solve this problem before Peucellier. Other linkages in this Reuleaux model collection are connected with some of the names of 19th century mathematicians who tried to solve the problem of how to draw a precise straight line. Reuleaux thought that these mechanisms were so important that he designed 39 straight line mechanisms for his collection, including those of Watt, Roberts, Evans, Chebyshev, Peuaucellier-Lipkin, Cartwright and some of his own design. See all models in the S-series.\nThe appearance in 1864 of Peaucellier's exact straight-line linkage went nearly unnoticed. Charles Nicolas Peaucellier (1832-1913) was a captain in the French army. He announced his \"inversor\" linkage in 1864 - in the form of a question and without explaining the solution - in a letter to the Nouvelles Annales. Eventually Peaucellier became a general and (as claimed by J.J. Sylvester) was in command of the fortress of Toul.\nFor at least 10 years before and 20 years after Peaucellier's final solution of the problem, Professor P.L. Chebyshev, a noted mathematician at the University of St. Petersburg was interested in the matter. Judging by his published works and his reputation abroad, his interest amounted to an obsession. In 1853, after visiting France and England and observing carefully the progress of applied mechanics in those countries, he wrote his first paper on approximate straight-line linkages, and over the next 30 years he attacked the problem with new vigor at least a dozen times. Chebyshev noted the departure of Watt's and Evans linkages from a straight line and calculated the deviation as of the fifth degree, or about 0.0008 inch per inch of beam length. He proposed a modification of Watt's linkage to refine the accuracy but concluded that it would \"present great practical difficulties.\"Then he got an idea that if one mechanism would be good, two would be better. So he combined two linkages and got as a result, what is usually called Chebyshev's linkage, in which precision was increased to 13th degree. The steam engine he displayed at the Vienna Exhibition of 1873 employed this linkage.\nIn 1871 Lipmann I. Lipkin (1851-1875) independently discovered the same straight-line linkage as Peaucellier and demonstrated a working model at the World Exhibition in Vienna 1873. After that Peaucellier published details of his discovery with a proof of his solution acknowledging Lipkin's independent discovery. Sylvester claims the French government awarded Peaucellier the \"Prix Montyon\" (1875) for his invention, whereas Lipkin received a \"substantial reward from the Russian government.\"[Kempe 1877] There is not much we know about Lipkin. Some sources mentioned that he was born in Lithuania and was Chebyshev's student but died before completing his doctoral dissertation.\nIn January 1874 James Joseph Sylvester (1814-1897) delivered a lecture \"Recent Discoveries in Mechanical Conversion of Motion.\" Sylvester's aim was to bring the Peaucellier-Lipkin linkage to the notice of the English-speaking world.Sylvester learned about this problem from Chebyshev - during a recent visit of the Russian to England.\n\"The perfect parallel motion of Peaucellier looks so simple, \" he observed, \"and moves so easily that people who see it at work almost universally express astonishment that it waited so long to be discovered.\" [Fergusson 1962]\nLater Mr. Prim, \"engineer to the Houses\" (the Houses of Parliament in London) was pleased to show his adaptation of Peaucellier linkage in his new \"blowing engines\" for the ventilation and filtration of the Houses. Those engines proved to be exceptionally quiet in their operation. [Kempe 1877]\nSylvester recalled his experience with a little mechanical model of the Peaucellier linkage at a dinner meeting of the Philosophical Club of the Royal Society. The Peaucellier model had been greeted by the members with lively expressions of admiration\n\"when it was brought in with the dessert, to be seen by them after dinner, as is the laudable custom among members of that eminent body in making known to each other the latest scientific novelties.\" [Fergusson 1962]\nAnd Sylvester would never forget the reaction of his brilliant friend Sir William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) upon being handed the same model in the Athenaeum Club. After Sir William had operated it for a time, Sylvester reached for the model, but he was rebuffed by the exclamation:\n\"No! I have not had nearly enough of it - it is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life.\" [Fergusson 1962]\nIn summer of 1876 Alfred Bray Kempe, a barrister who pursued mathematics as a hobby, delivered at London's South Kensington Museum a lecture with the provocative title \"How to Draw a Straight Line\" which in the next year was published in a small book. In this book you can find pictures of the linkages we have mentioned here. Kempe essentially knew that linkages (rigid bars constrained to a plane and joined at their ends by rivets) are capable of drawing any algebraic curve. Other authors provided more complete proofs during the period 1877-1902. More about the many connections between linkages and such problems of modern mathematics as algebraic completeness, rigidity, NP completeness can be read in Warren D. Smith paper \"Plane mechanisms and the 'downhill principle'\".\nPeaucellier-Lipkin linkage is also used in computer science to prove theorems about workspace topology in robotics .

Kirsty Black\u2019s abstract art is like visual poetry. Instead of words and sentences, she intuitively uses colour, shape, line, form, pattern and texture to create a visual dance of the spirit.\nThe loose nature of these paintings belies the honed sense of composition, and deep understanding of the workings of colour to create such successful pieces.\nBlack\u2019s images are born from her nomadic lifestyle growing up, responses to her personal experiences of travel, digesting local colour from Asia to Africa, creating from a visual catalogue which frequently surfaces in her work.\nRock Pool Treasure Hunt is a striking example of how Black creates luminous and complex tangles of colour. The sumptuous colour palette draws you in. Her art is an experience. You must let go of your need to put things into words, and let the artwork take you somewhere... lift you into another sphere. Look at the painting like you would listen to a symphony, not trying to hold on to the notes - let them wash over you. Let your eyes wander over the painting the way the notes of a symphony wash over your soul. Let your eyes play with the painting, slipping around corners, following the twirls, twists and turns, dipping in and out of the surface. Let your eyes dance around the piece.\nBlack finds it is the perfect way to express lofty, intangible concepts - such as the notion of a happier existence here on this planet if we nurture the sense of belonging we get by spending time with family and friends. \u201cStorytelling is a family tradition, something we all love. Both my grandfathers were fabulous raconteurs. The weaving of the story brings you together, creates a sense of belonging and is often highly entertaining \u2013 elaboration, interjection and theatrics are all welcome!\u201d explains Black. She sees painting as an extension of this tradition, and in an increasingly homogenised world which is rife with distressing news and events it is a medium where she can give her imagination free rein, creating light-hearted, joyful works. \u201cMy aim is to convey a sense of joy and prompt the viewer to continue the story or to come up with their own.\u201d\nEffervescent Dreaming is an exploration into the deep pools of human emotions with a strong focus on the positive and uplifting. Exuberant and large paintings, uniting the aesthetics of art and the sensual complexities of living.

You know, that final moment when our entire lives flash before our eyes and everything we have ever known or loved fades away from view in a gradual drop into darkness.\nDeath (and what comes next) is the one thing that has always eluded humankind and yet it fascinates us, thrills us and peaks our curiosity more than anything we have ever come across in life.\nWhat if I told you I KNOW what comes next? What if I told YOU I know without any shadow of a doubt what happens when you die? Well then, do I have your attention?\nOver the next couple of weeks I will share FIVE accounts of near death experience with you, however only ONE of them is actually real.\nThe question is, which one will it be?\n*** If you are of a nervous or squeamish disposition then it would be best you stop here! You have been warned!! ***\nThe Dark Chasm!\nPart I - The Beginning\n\u201cThat smell? What is it? That burning smell? Is that Petrol?\u201d\nI quickly became very aware I was laid on my back. The cold ground beneath me was hard, like rock and the sights and sounds around me were blurred.\nAs I tried to move I soon realised I couldn\u2019t, but why? What was stopping me? WHY COULDN\u2019T I GET UP?!\nLights around me flashed a vibrant ray of different colours. Red, blue, yellow!\nIt was the dark sky above my head however that soon caught my attention, and that\u2019s when I felt a cold breath of evening air against my face.\nI once again tried to get up, however as soon as I did I realised I had nothing to grip the ground with, nothing to help pull me up.\nI looked to my right hand side and as my surroundings gradually came back into focus that\u2019s when I saw it, THE BLOOD! SO MUCH BLOOD!\nI looked down at my arm and the shock suddenly set in. There was no arm! Just a stump, a bloody, fleshy mangled stump.\nIt was at that point that I saw my reflection in the smashed car door next to me. What I saw horrified me beyond belief!\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to me?\u201d I screamed! \u201cWhere am I?\u201d\nThe weird thing was, no-one replied. No matter how much I shouted, cried or screamed no-one seemed to be paying any attention to me.\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be real\u201d, \u201csurely this is just a nightmare, I\u2019ll wake up soon, I\u2019m sure of it\u201d.\nSuddenly there was a loud BANG and bits of bloody flesh scattered around me almost as if somebody had just thrown a barrel of mince meat at me.\nSlowly, everything started to fade, gradually becoming quieter and quieter, darker and darker.\nI could feel myself slipping slowly downwards, almost as if the ground was swallowing me up like quick sand and as I slipped deeper and deeper into the abyss below me I quickly realised that this wasn\u2019t a dream.\n\u201cWHAT IS THAT?\u201d\nPart II - The Descent\nAs Jim continued to fall ever downwards he slowly became aware of the fact he had no control.\nNo matter how hard he fought the force pulling him ever downwards he couldn\u2019t break free of it\u2019s steely grasp.\nThe darkness continued to engulf him, and with no light in sight Jim had no idea of just how vast the area around him was.\nSuddenly a sulfurous smell filled the air, and a faint orange glow seemed to emanate from below him as he continued to fall.\n\u201cWhat is HAPPENING?!\u201d Jim screamed, \u201cWhere am I? What\u2019s going on?!\u201d\nA deep rumbling voice boomed from the darkness below him \u201cYOU\u2019RE MINE! Your soul belongs to me!\u201d\n\u201cWHAT IS HAPPENING?\u201d Jim cried out again as he continued to fall towards what appeared to be a vast chasm with jagged rocks surrounding it\u2019s edges.\nThe deep voice boomed back in reply again once more \u201cyou\u2019re dead, and now THERE\u2019S HELL TO PAY!\u201d\n\u201cNo! I can\u2019t be? It\u2019s no possible\u201d\nJim tried to rationalise what was happening, however the only problem was, he couldn\u2019t! This didn\u2019t make sense.\nOut of nowhere a high pitched hissing voice whispered in his ear \u201cOh, but it is, and now you will suffer for your sins!\u201d\nThe faint orange glow suddenly erupted into a sea of molten lava, and that\u2019s when he heard it, the screams! Billions of souls writhing in agony beneath him.\nJim hit the lava and as he slowly sank into it, the smell of burning flesh permeating the air as he did so he could feel the hands of those around him clawing at him like knives, ripping him apart as they did so.\nAll of a sudden, everything stopped. Everything went quiet.\nThen that\u2019s when he felt it, that feeling of weightlessness as he once again began to fall ever downwards.\n\u201cNow you are stuck, and stuck you shall remain!\u201d boomed the deep voice out of the darkness below him.\nIt was at that point Jim realised, he was was destined to relive this same moment, this same horrifying ordeal over and over for the rest of eternity.", "probabilities": 0.06963155418634415}

Our trips consist of a shorter four-hour trip up to overnight private deep sea fishing trips. The four-hour deep sea fishing trip is basically an introduction to fishing. All of the rest are formatted around the experienced fisherpersons. We use frozen Squid for bait on most trips and a variety of different dead baits. We usually use as much of the live bait that we harvest. Our daily trips are from six to twelve hours long. We can carry up to 49 people on the Emerald Spirit and 30 on the C.A.T.\nOn our overnight private deep sea fishing trips we do what serious fisher people want \u2013 non-stop deep sea fishing for the entire trip. We start the trip by catching as much live bait as possible in a reasonable amount of time on the way out. Then we start bottom fishing our way offshore to where we will eventually get out to the big Yellow-fin Tuna and Swordfish in the deeper seas. As soon as we get underway, the deckhands put out trolling lines for high-speed sport fish such as Wahoo, King Mackerel, and Dolphin. As on all of our trips, we fish for Cobia, Red Snapper, Triggerfish, Grouper, Amberjack, Mingo Snapper, Scamp and other deeper sea species. As much as our time on the trip allows will be as long as we keep deep sea fishing.\nIn all cases, we end up having to clean fish at the end of the trip. Don\u2019t forget to tip the deckhand because this is where they work the hardest cleaning the fish. We want to make sure your trip is the best one you\u2019ve been on yet and be one you\u2019ll remember and tell all of your friends about the deep sea fishing trip with us. Most of our business is repeat customers who will testify to how good of a deep sea fishing trip they have with us every year. We want you to have fun with your family and friends and return to us the next time you ever think of deep sea fishing.\nAt Action Charter Service, we offer an affordable private deep sea fishing experience that is truly a bargain and often create memories that last a lifetime.
