(5.0 x 6.1 x 2.1 m)\nCommissioned November 1985 by Etablissement Public du Parc de la Villette\nInstalled November 1990\nCoosje's thoughts on Samuel Beckett's anti-hero Molloy -- who falls off his bicycle and finds himself lying in a ditch unable to recognize the object -- prompted her selection of a bicycle as the subject for an \"intervention\" we had been asked to propose by the French Ministry of Culture. The work was to be incorporated into the new Parc de la Villette, designed by the architect Bernard Tschumi, on the outskirts of Paris. The bicycle has close ties to France, having been invented there and celebrated in the Tour de France. Its parts have also been featured in art, from Picasso's bull's head made out of a bicycle seat and handlebars to Marcel Duchamp's bicycle wheel mounted on a stool. In fact, we decided that the parts and details were better subjects for a configuration of sculptural elements than the unwieldy whole; our solution was to bury most of the vehicle. Doing this allowed us to select a large scale appropriate to the park's wide spaces. We settled on an invisible bicycle, 150 feet 11 inches long, with the front wheel turned slightly so that a portion would protrude above the ground, and plotted the locations of a pedal, one half of the seat, and one handlebar with a bell, using a sawed-up standard bicycle that our daughter had outgrown as a model. Where Molloy's bicycle bell had been red, the Buried Bicycle's would be blue, in contrast to a number of red \"follies\" the architect had placed in the park.\nThe inevitability of the placement of the parts in relation to one another as defined by the bicycle mimicked the grid of the park. At the same time, however, our self-contained configuration was dropped as if by chance over that of the park, causing the pedal to intrude on the courtyard of the Folie Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re and the space occupied by a group of Philippe Starck chairs. We responded to this by simply turning the pedal, our bicycle pedaling on.\nBack to Large-Scale Projects\nTop of Page", "probabilities": 0.2692440450191498}

Most companies don't cover performance products at all, but the Driveshaft shop believes in our products and is willing to go the extra mile for you. If you have a warranty claim do not reorder the axle and send in the old one as a defect. The claim will be repaired and you will have 2 axles.\nHow long will a repair take?\nTurn around time is about 3-4 days. We will cover UPS ground shipping (within the states) only.

Before you invest time and money into having your floors covered in epoxy, you must do a vapor test.\nYou see, concrete breathes, it wicks out moisture, sub foundation moisture from below the surface. And when you cover the surface with a solid epoxy layer, well, moisture can build up and cause the adhesion of the product to fail. Then you are talking about removal of the bad layer, and with epoxy, patch and filling bad areas is not a viable option.\nMake sure a vapor test is performed first, this will tell you if epoxy coatings for your floors is even an option. Okay, so lets say you did the vapor moisture test and everything is okay. The next thing that's going to happen is you will need to prep the surface for the adding of epoxy.\nThis is done by grinding, scratching up the face of the concrete, this will help the adhering properties of the epoxy to work best. Then it's off to fix the cracks and holes in your existing floor. Contractors use a wide range of specialized products for filling in these spots; and then the repaired areas are grinded down to match the surface level of the rest of the floor.\nAfter that, the floor needs to be cleaned so that there is no dust or dirt left over from the floor repair work. Any contaminants left behind will weaken the bonding agents of the epoxy to the surface. This is the one rule you can't cut corners on, your concrete surface has to be clean.\nNext, a mixing station/area is set up to prepare the chemical combinations of the epoxy, and then it is poured onto the floor and squeegeed to the desired thickness. On the bottom of these specialized squeegee tools, they can be adjusted for depth, so that the epoxy product is in deed the same thickness across the floor.\nOne of the big problems at this point for most pour jobs, is BUGS! That's right, those pesky little critters that fly over your newly poured finish to find a spot you can't reach; or worse yet, if you touch it, you'll snow cone that spot. Snow coning means instead of being flat like the rest of the surface, you make a small snow cone shaped area pop up from the floor.\nThese problem bug areas have to be worked out after the floor is poured. Your contractor knows how to make the best of it, and don't get upset when you see that first kamikaze bug hit the surface, it's all part of life with pouring an epoxy floor. Your local contractor knows how to correct little bug problems without messing up the rest of the floor. But when the surface has cured, and is ready to use, an epoxy coated floor can be one of the most beautiful surfaces that you could hope for. Designs, patterns and lines can be ground into the existing epoxy and later filled with grout to give a tiled effect.\nCheck with your local concrete flooring contractor to see if your floor can handle an epoxy coating. You'll love the selection of colors; they can be made to match any design project for your retail, warehouse, airport hanger, industrial setting and large residential project. Call your local concrete polishing contractor today and get a free estimate, find out if Epoxy coatings are for you.", "probabilities": 0.1232386901974678}
