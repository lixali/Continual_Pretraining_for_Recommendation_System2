The developers at ScummVM took their love of these \u201890s games and coded an open-source platform so they can be played on modern devices. All you need are the games\u2019 original data files, and you can get them up and running again on PCs, Macs, smart TVs, Android devices, and even gaming consoles. Whether you want to go back to \u201cMonkey Island\u201d or \u201cManiac Mansion,\u201d ScummVM can help you relive your digital youth.\nContemporary computer games are more realistic than ever \u2014 and not just in the details of their polygons and shading. Games like \u201cStar Wars: Battlefront II,\u201d \u201cCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare,\u201d and \u201cRise of the Tomb Raider\u201d incorporate physics engines creating detail so intricate that it sometimes makes them appear more real than RL.\nThey\u2019re amazing and a blast to get lost in, certainly, but what about the games we played as kids? Just because the classics, such as \u201cSam & Max Hit the Road,\u201d \u201cUrban Runner,\u201d and \u201cKing\u2019s Quest\u201d were low-res and low-tech by today\u2019s standards doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t high-fun.\nWe know where those days went \u2014 unfortunately, we all grew up and so did technology. But the developers at ScummVM have now made it possible to relive the pixelated, brightly colored, and incredibly fun computer games we played as kids.\nWhen a group of \u201890s kids grew up and started coding to make money, they began to reminisce about the games they played in their youth. Many of them still owned the games\u2019 original data files, but there wasn\u2019t a way to run them on modern devices. So they decided to do something about it. The result was ScummVM \u2014 an ethical, open-source program that allows you to play your childhood point-and-click computer games on contemporary computers, smart TVs, mobile devices, and even gaming consoles.\nBringing Digital Childhoods Back to Life by Replacing the Executables\nScummVM is an acronym that stands for Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion, which was a utility used to create the game \u201cManiac Mansion\u201d and, later, most \u201890s LucasArts games such as the \u201cMonkey Island\u201d and \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d series, \u201cSam & Max Hit the Road,\u201d and \u201cFull Throttle.\u201d\nThe \u201cVM\u201d part stands for Virtual Machine. Many original game engines were running some sort of virtual high level machines to enhance compatibility. ScummVM implements these VMs on modern platforms, enabling old computer games to run on systems they were never designed for.\nScummVM is also ethical. ScummVM won\u2019t supply you with the game data files, which would be tantamount to distributing warez, or pirated software. However, in some cases, the ScummVM team was able to secure the rights to distribute some games as freeware. Users can find those in the relevant download section on the ScummVM website.\nInstead, you have to already own the game so that ScummVM can access its data files. Then, the platform merely replaces the game\u2019s executable file, allowing it to run on an array of modern devices, on most of which the executable simply wouldn\u2019t run natively. And, for most games, you won\u2019t need to run an installer. All you have to do is run ScummVM, point it to the location of your game files on a floppy, CD, or hard drive, and teleport back to after school at Mom and Dad\u2019s house.\nPlay the Classics \u2014 From LucasArts to Leisure Suit Larry\nGet ready to swing that sword, whip, or whatever! ScummVM is compatible with a long and growing list of your favorite childhood point-and-click computer games. Nearly any game that used the Script Creation Utility for \u201cManiac Mansion\u201d is playable, including the namesake and original subject of the technology, a 1987 B-film inspired game whose objective is to help teenage would-be hero Dave Miller rescue his girlfriend from a mad scientist.\nIf \u201cManiac Mansion\u201d isn\u2019t to your taste, you can play a long list of other formerly popular titles \u2014 and the list below is just a sample of the LucasArts games available:\n- Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\n- The Secret of Monkey Island\n- Monkey Island 2: LeChuck\u2019s Revenge\n- Sam & Max Hit the Road\n- Full Throttle\n- The Dig\n- The Curse of Monkey Island\nActivision classics can also be run with ScummVM. \u201cReturn to Zork\u201d and \u201cThe Manhole\u201d are compatible, as are several Elvira games, including \u201cWaxworks,\u201d \u201cSimon the Sorcerer 1 & 2,\u201d and the \u201cGoblins\u201d series from Coktel Vision. The list goes on, and following are just a few more:\n- Urban Runner\n- The King\u2019s Quest series\n- Space Quest 1 & Space Quest 2\n- Backyard Baseball\n- Backyard Football\nFor a more libidinous return to your prepubescent, lights-out computer gaming sessions, you can stumble your way through ham-fisted seduction all over again with \u201cLeisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards\u201d or \u201cLeather Goddesses of Phobos 2: Gas Pump Girls Meet the Pulsating Inconvenience from Planet X.\u201d\nA complete list of compatible games, along with any notable problems and glitches, can be found on the ScummVM website.\nEasily Install and Get Running With Demos of Popular \u201890s Titles\nNow that your mind is awash in nostalgia, what do you need to run ScummVM and all those point-and-click games from your childhood?\nOf course, ScummVM can run your old games on Windows and Mac, and Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu flavors of UNIX \u2014 and several versions of each \u2014 but also on less obvious devices such as Android and side-loadable iOS devices, Raspberry Pi, the 2009-series of Samsung TVs, OS/2, AmigaOS, and others. It can even be loaded onto gaming consoles and devices such as the Dreamcast, PlayStation 3, and PSP.\nEvery effort is made to make ScummVM as feature-complete as possible, and it\u2019s continually improved upon through active volunteer development. (See below to learn how you can help ScummVM\u2019s development.) Still, it\u2019s a reimplementation of old tech and devices such as sound cards on new, and sometimes just other tech and operating systems. Most things work with most games \u2014 including CD audio and saving games \u2014 but it\u2019s possible you may encounter something that doesn\u2019t work. Importing old saved games from before installing ScummVM, for instance, rarely works.\nIf you don\u2019t have a game lying around and you want to try out ScummVM before investing in that eBay copy of \u201cMonkey Island 2,\u201d you can download a number of game demos directly from the ScummVM website. The demos themselves are sought after by nostalgia game enthusiasts because, back in the \u201890s, most computer game demos were playable, with special content included. Thus, even without the full game, you can relive your childhood \u2014 one level at a time.\nAn Open Invitation to Contribute to ScummVM\nScummVM is an open-source project licensed under the GNU Public License. It\u2019s actively being developed and improved and is community supported. If you\u2019d like to help, the ScummVM team would be glad to receive any assistance you can provide.\nCoders are always welcome to work on the next version or bug fixes. Translators, too, are desired to help bring ScummVM to a wider audience. It\u2019s currently available in the most common languages \u2014 English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish \u2014 but other translations are still in the works and need multilingual volunteers to complete them. Contributions can be relayed to the ScummVM team via its forum or GitHub page where its developers frequently hang out.\nIf you have no coding skills but still want to help, the project will gladly accept a donation of your hard-earned cash. Just click the PayPal Donate button at the bottom of the website\u2019s sidebar to help defray the ScummVM overhead, which includes hosting and domain name fees.\nNext time you\u2019re stressed out, grab your Capri Sun and Go-Gurt, and turn back time to the good old days with ScummVM and your favorite childhood point-and-click computer game.", "probabilities": 0.0020562841091305017}

A third of the harvesting takes place in new pi\u00e8ces and the rest in vats, then aged for a year or so. This exceptional white wine develops complex and subtle aromas of quince, ginger, honey and acacia with a note of linden. Remarkably rich on the palate, with a rather long-lasting almond finish, it can be kept for many years. Maison Chapoutier is without doubt one of the most prestigious names in the Rh\u00f4ne producing some of the finest Hermitage. The domain converted its 350 hectares of vines to biodynamic viticulture, making it the largest vineyard to adopt this method of cultivation. It has held certification since 1999. The Chapoutier savoir faire has spread to other vineyards in other winemaking regions: Provence, Beaujolais, Roussillon, Champagne, Alsace, Portugal but also Australia. In 1879, Polydor Chapoutier bought a few hectares of vines and started a negociant business. Seven generations have succeeded him, and Michel Chapoutier is currently at the helm. Since 1996, all the labels have been transcribed in braille. Chapoutier is often one of the last to harvest to ensure that grapes reach optimal maturity.", "probabilities": 0.002347953850403428}
