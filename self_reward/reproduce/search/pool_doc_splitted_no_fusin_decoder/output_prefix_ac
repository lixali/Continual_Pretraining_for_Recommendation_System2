Because the pragma remains silent when the module is run from a non-core library directory, the pragma call does not need to be patched into or out of either the core or CPAN version of the module. The exact same code can be shipped for either purpose.\nNote that when a module installs from CPAN to a core library directory rather than the site library directories, the user gains no protection from having installed it.\nAt the same time, this pragma cannot detect when such a module has installed from CPAN to the core library, and so it would endlessly and uselessly exhort the user to upgrade.\nTherefore modules that can install from CPAN to the core library must make sure not to call this pragma when they have done so. Generally this means that the exact logic from the installer must be mirrored inside the module. E.g.:\n# Makefile.PL WriteMakefile( # ... INSTALLDIRS => ( \"$]\" >= 5.011 ? 'site' : 'perl' ), ); # lib/Foo/Bar.pm use if \"$]\" >= 5.011, 'deprecate';\n(The above example shows the most important case of this: when the target is a Perl older than 5.12 (where the core library directories take precedence over the site library directories) and the module being installed was included in core in that Perl version. Under those circumstances, an upgrade of the module from CPAN is only possible by installing to the core library.)\nNone by default.

Some astute observers might have noticed the art style was similar to the previously released Mix Au Lait and Saiko Soda promotions, and you would be correct; Delicious Water was part of this same series, but with a watery twist.\nThe mascot plush were the most popular from this release, and rightfully so. There was a plush made for each water starter Pokemon from the current 7 Pokemon regions.\nWhy does only Piplup get a crown? My guess\u2026 there is someone involved with Pokemon merchandising who loves Piplup, which explains why he gets so much merchandise while simultaneously not selling well ever. You can push it all you want, Piplup person, but it\u2019s not going to happen (I\u2019m sorry).\nAlong with the main Delicious Water items, there were a bunch of Saiko Soda stuff as well, including bags and t-shirts.\nFollowing in the footsteps of the last Mix Au Lait release, the Delicious Water promotion also included a gacha set with each figure being paired with a mini bottle of water figure.\nJapanese Style June\nJune 16th (Saturday) saw the release of the Japanese Style promotion, featuring a bunch of more traditional Japanese items with a Pokemon twist.\nThere were a lot of neat items, but some highlights included: a set of four plates, four different 2 plate sets, two different types of bento boxes, super cute chopsticks with Umbreon and Espeon, aprons, and traditional Japanese short pants for wearing outside in summer when it\u2019s hot.\nAn unannounced mini Pokemon Center promotion, featuring mostly apparel with a neon theme and aptly titled \u201cNeon Color\u201d, came out June 22nd (Saturday).\nAlthough maybe not too exciting, the set included phone cases, some bags, t-shirts, hats, and a bunch of socks.\nSock designs included: Pikachu,\nA new set of Chokkori-san sitting plush came out near the end of June.\nThis set of 8 plush included: Popplio, Litten, Rowlet, Lillie, Alolan Vulpix, Mew, Mewtwo, and Zeraora.\nI love this series because the plush look so cute in their little sitting poses and also they can hold things with their tiny hands!\nEeveelution Pass Case\nJune 29th (Saturday) had a couple of surprise unannounced releases, one being a set of Eeveelution plush face pass cases.\nThey\u2019re all cute (and soft!) but Umbreon is my favorite \u2764\nDitto Charm Sets\nAnother June 29th unannounced release \u2013 Ditto Transform linking charm sets!\nIt\u2019s been so long since the last release of these charm sets I forgot they existed, so it was kind of a nice surprise.\nThere were 6 charm sets in total:\nLeafeon, Glaceon, Sylveon\nFurret, Alolan Vulpix, Dragonite\nWhimsicott, Gloom, Shaymin\nLapras, Magikarp, Omanyte\nMareep, Electrode, Magnemite\nLitwick, Sableye, Misdreavus\nSome of these sets make complete sense. Some of them\u2026 don\u2019t. But that\u2019s fine! The Pokemon Center can do what it wants as always.\nNext Pokemon Center Report will cover the Pokemon World Market release so stay tuned!\nConnect & Support\nTwitter | Instagram | Facebook\nKo-fi | TeePublic | Patreon\nTwo quick words before I dive into this week\u2019s Pokemon Center Report~\nFirst off, big apologizes for the lack of updates lately! The blog is not ending, but two weeks in a row we didn\u2019t get merchandise news from the main Pokemon website and then my main source for Pokemon Center photos was on holiday in the United States.\nBut we are back so I appreciate everyone\u2019s patience.\nSecond \u2013 the official Zombie Miki store is back in business, with a new look and with more items!\nCheck it out here\nI will be adding items in as quickly as I can. Most of these items are from my personal collection and were bought directly from the Pokemon Center in Tokyo over the course of 7 years. They\u2019re all in near perfect if not perfect condition, but if you have any questions about an item, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me!\nOn that note, if you notice any issues with the cart or checking out, or if you have a question about shipping prices, also please let me know (you can send me a message through my contact page or send me a DM on Twitter). I am happy to offer discounted shipping for larger purchases \ud83d\ude42\nAlso as mentioned, I am selling a good majority of my Pokemon merchandise collections, which includes some bigger items such as the New Years Fennekin sleeping plush, New Years Fennekin face cushion, and a complete set of the Monthly Pikachu collection. The Pokemon I collected over the years include: Fennekin, Meowstic, Litwick, Mew, Clefairy, Raichu, Dedenne, Holiday Pikachu, Sylveon, and Vulpix (Kanto & Alolan versions). If there is a specific item you are looking for, there is a good chance I have it and am selling it, so please ask me directly.\nThe release of the original 151 Kanto region Pokemon Fit plushies were a great success, but even I was still surprised when the Pokemon Center announced they would be continuing the Sitting Cuties series (the international release name) with all Pokemon featured in Gold & Silver\u2026 including every single Unown plus ! and ?\n(Pictured here is M for Miki, of course)\nAlthough I couldn\u2019t take pictures of every Pokemon in the release, here are a few notable examples~\nPokemon Fit Gold Silver 1\nI love this series so much mainly because the plush are all super soft and the perfect size.\nPictured here: Chikorita, Cyndaquil, Totodile, Sentret, Furret (not to scale), Cleffa, Mareep, Flaaffy, and Ampharos (one of the most popular electric type Pokemon!)\nPokemon Fit Gold Silver 2\nI didn\u2019t realize until this release how many Johto region Pokemon I love, and the Pokemon Center did a great job converting everyone\u2019s favorite Pokemon into a super adorable plush form.\nI think they did an especially great job with Sudowoodo (which, by the way, is a play on words since he is psuedo-wood-o\u2026 in case you didn\u2019t know!)\nAlso shout out to the second official Dunsparce plush \u2013 the first plush was released at Pokemon Centers in Japan in 2013.\nPictured here: Sudowoodo, Politoed, Espeon, Umbreon, Girafarig, Dunsparce, Delibird, Houndour, and Houndoom.\nPokemon Fit Gold Silver 3\nOther notable plushies: Smeargle and Miltank (both very cute).\nThe three legendary beasts came out looking, for the most part, pretty good. My real question is\u2026 what animal do you think the beasts are? (I always saw them as dogs)\nPictured here: Stantler, Smeargle, Miltank, Blissey, Raikou, Entei, Suicune.\nPokemon Fit Plush Gold Silver 4\nLast but not least \u2013 everyone\u2019s favorite recently, most likely because of Pokemon Go: The Tar Family! Tyranitar was definitely one of the big sellers from the release, no joke.\nPictured here: Larvitar, Tyranitar, Lugia, Ho-oh, Celebi\nWhat was your favorite plush, or plushes, from this release?

Unlike a biography, which tends to be a relatively straightforward look at a person\u2019s life, a memoir consists of their collected memories. It may be presented in chronological order, order of most importance, or how each memory leads into the next. As long as people have been committing words to writing, they have written memoirs. From the ancient world, to the modern, memoirs have only grown in popularity as a way to pass down one\u2019s own legacy. Not all of us are destined to become legendary poets and writers, many people are forgotten as time passes. But a memoir can be an extension of a life. The Fire Never Goes Out: A Memoir in Pictures is what is known as a graphic memoir containing both her words and her artwork in a masterful combination.\nEvery chapter in a story has a responsibility to the overall narrative. This is most evident in trilogies, where the first novel sets up the stakes and the characters, the second builds upon the threat, and the finale contains the climax of all that came before. The saga of the Witcher is atypical in its structure and how each novel contributes to the narrative. On top of that, the story began long before the novels were written, in the world crafted by the original series of short stories. Despite its odd nature as a five-novel story, the fourth book, The Tower of the Swallow, still has a responsibility as the penultimate chapter in the tale of Ciri, Geralt, and Yennefer. It must continue the adventure that has come before, while escalating the stakes. Some characters begin the lead up to the finale, while others are brought to their lowest point in preparation for their eventual rise.\nOne of the longest enduring staples in fiction is that of the Chosen One. The Chosen One is the special hero, standing above all others as the only one capable of defeating the enemy of the story or saving the world. The method for selecting a chosen one can be varied. In many stories, there is some form of prophecy which only fits this one individual. In others, they may have a certain birthmark or be born from the right parents at just the right time. This trope is not even relegated to one genre. Chosen one are found all throughout fantasy, science-fiction, and beyond. Harry Potter may be one of the most recognizable examples, but the chosen one can also be found in Star Wars in the form of Anakin Skywalker, and in The Matrix with Neo. Even The Lord of the Rings, which posits that anyone can defeat evil if they have the courage to rise up, contains a chosen one to a certain extent with Eowyn. However, the chosen one has waned in popularity. There are no chosen ones in real life.\nA \u201cbaptism of fire\u201d can be defined in several different ways. Classically, and for most of literary history, it referred to a specific passage from the Gospel according to Matthew in the Catholic Bible. According to John the Baptist, who baptized Catholics with water, God would come after and baptize their followers with the Holy Spirit and with fire. The phrase also appears in the Gospel according to Luke and Dante\u2019s Inferno referring to a fiery trial of faith which would purify those who looked upon God.

{"id": "<urn:uuid:f2a43f5c-a7b2-4cd8-8da1-b1e975b2e457>", "text": "Should I eat a special breastfeeding diet?\nSimilar to pregnancy; the golden rule for breastfeeding moms: eat a balanced diet. It is important to keep up the good habits acquired during pregnancy. In general, it is advisable to eat 500 calories more than the normal amount you consumed before getting pregnant. However, this could be too much for some women and too little for others, depending on the energy reserves built up during pregnancy and each woman\u00b4s level of physical activity.\nInclude 2 servings of fresh fruits and vegetables each everyday in your meals and snacks to get all the necessary vitamins and minerals, and keep well hydrated by drinking 1.5 to 2 liters of water a day, especially during hot weather. Your body also needs calcium in order to maintain good bone mass, iron to avoid deficiencies, proteins and all of the other nutrients that you will pass along to your baby in your milk. By getting a good supply of complex carbohydrates at breakfast time, you'll have the energy to start your day right. At lunch and dinner time, have potatoes, pasta or whole-grain rice, or beans and legumes. This will provide you with a constant source of energy throughout the day. You can also eat smaller, more frequent amounts by having a healthy mid-morning snack (for example: a medium-sized apple with light yogurt). Never skip breakfast, even if your baby disturbs your normal daily cycles\nCan a poor diet affect my breast milk?\nRecent studies have shown that your breast milk will still be of good quality for your baby, even if you do not eat properly. In fact, the most important thing is for you to have good nutrition for the sake of your own health and your general condition. Otherwise, your body will ensure the quality of your milk is maintained at the expense of your own reserves of nutrients, such as your body\u00b4s calcium reserves. You need to recover from the fatigue of your delivery in order to be able to care for your baby. This fatigue could lead to a condition of stress that could cause your breast milk production to decrease.\nWill I lose weight when breastfeeding?\nThey say that breastfeeding helps with weight loss. That is true: your body\u00b4s hormones caused you to store about 3-4kg of fat for breast-feeding your baby. You will lose these reserves gradually as you breast-feed, simply because these reserves will be used during the production milk. In addition, your body is still working in \u201cburnout\u201d mode, like that of an athlete, and it needs to recover from the fatigue of childbirth, so just be patient!\nWhat can my baby taste in my breast milk?\nIf you ate everything when you were pregnant, you can continue doing so. People say that certain foods like cabbage, asparagus, garlic, onions, bell peppers and certain condiments have a reputation for giving mother's milk \"a strange taste,\" but that doesn't bother the baby, because he or she is already familiar with them since they were present in the amniotic fluid. Your culinary habits and culture have already been passed along to your baby during pregnancy, and afterwards through your milk. The formation of your baby\u2019s tastes started when he or she was still in the womb.\nHow can I increase milk production?\nThere are a lot of \u201cold wives' tales\u201d out there regarding how to improve your breast milk production. Fennel tea, barley malt and hops in alcohol-free beer, white thistle, coriander (cilantro), green anise, dill, basil, lentils and quinoa have all been associated with promoting milk production. There is no scientific evidence to back up these claims. Do not consume large amounts, because plants contain active ingredients that can be harmful to your baby in large doses. What we do know for certain is that you should drink plenty of fluids to promote milk production: 1.5 to 2 liters of liquid a day. There is a myth that this should largely be milk; however, hydration is what matters most, so water is the best option. You should also rest after breastfeeding your baby.\nWhat should I avoid eating when breastfeeding?\nBe careful with toxic or potentially toxic products that can be passed through your milk: caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, medications, and pesticides found on fruit peels and skins. Hence, try to avoid or reduce intake of caffeinated beverages like coffee or cola, quit smoking, do not drink alcohol or self-medicate and ensure you wash your fruits and vegetables carefully.\nTake advantage of this wonderful adventure that you are beginning with your baby: it is enriching in every way, and always will be. Pregnancy and breastfeeding are the times when many mothers learn about health and nutrition. Many mothers have stated that they learned how to eat well, how to shop correctly and even how to cook delicious and healthy meals during and after their pregnancy.", "probabilities": 0.00651149358600378}

After getting a bit burnt out by the piece and its attendant folklore, I\u2019m refreshed by hearing Dudamel\u2019s rendition.\nIn a clever programming touch, the Stravinsky is paired with Silvestre Revueltas\u2019 La Noche de los Mayas. Originally a 1939 film score, a concert suite of the work was only fashioned some two decades after Revueltas\u2019 death. Latin dance signatures and melodic inflections are offset by virtuosic percussion writing, including some cadenzas that help to make evident the musical kinship between Rite of Spring and La Noche de los Mayas.\nThe sociocultural resonances are obvious as well. It might seem gruesome to pair works based on their common interest in human sacrifice, but Rite restores the vitality and bite of early modernism\u2019s interest in still-earlier primitivism.\nComments Off on The Kids are All Rite", "probabilities": 0.0028860026504844427}

I liked the fit of this shoe from the minute I put them on, they were very comfortable for me right from the start.

There is a leather strap that closes over the top of the shoelaces to help prevent a loose lace from getting hooked on something. There is some stiff material in the heel and toe areas also, to provide some protection and to help the shoe retain its shape when shifting.
