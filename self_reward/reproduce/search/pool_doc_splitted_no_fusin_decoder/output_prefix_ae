Paul Duggan, a young Irish military intelligence officer, is on a secret mission to Portugal to uncover German intentions towards neutral Ireland and, even more secretly, to find out who had informed the Americans of an Irish Minister's undiplomatic comments while in Lisbon on his way to Washington to plead for arms. Meanwhile, an unmarked American plane crashes in Ireland and its cargo of beer, cigarettes and caviare make their way into the local black market with unforeseen consequences. Then it turns out there was something more than booze on board - a piece of secret military hardware of great interest to the Germans. Duggan and his colleagues find themselves in a complex game of diplomacy and disinformation as politicians in Ireland and America fall out and the spy agencies of Germany, Britain and the United States maneuver for political and military advantage. With the help of his Special Branch friend, Peter Gifford, he tries to unravel the plots and avoid the pitfalls. To do so he has to return to Lisbon, the war's spy center, where the interlocking intrigues threaten the future of Ireland's relations with America, put its neutrality at risk, and finally threaten his own life and that of the woman he loves.\nWe Also Recommend\nA Brief Guide to Philosophical Classics, From Plato to Winnie the Pooh; James M.

You can\u2019t have cookies for breakfast, Big Macs for dinner, plop yourself on a cardio machine for an hour, and expect to see results. Eating a box of thin mints won\u2019t make you thin. Your body needs proteins, healthy fats, and yes you do need carbs. Some research has even suggested that carbs can prevent weight gain and aid in weight loss. Whole grains help to reduce total body fat, and lower cholesterol. Foods like oatmeal, or some type of bran cereal before exercise may help burn more fat because they contain slow release carbs. Foods like white toast contains quick release carbs which can spike insulin levels, and trigger the body to store fat. Don\u2019t be afraid to eat carbs, just make sure you\u2019re eating the right carbs. Aim for low-fat dairy products, whole grains, beans, brown rice and vegetables.\nScales do lie:\nStop trying to be skinny, and start trying to be strong. Don\u2019t burn your energy focusing on your current weight, and how different that is from the weight you want to be. Stressing about the amount of pounds you want to lose and the bridge you have to cross to get there can be disheartening, especially if the pounds aren\u2019t melting away as quickly as the most recent snow storm. How much weight can you lift? How far can you walk? Keep track of these numbers, and ignore the scale. These are the numbers that are important. As these numbers increase, so will your endurance, and strength. Keep track of sets, reps and cardio. Every week you should try to increase your duration, speed, incorporate weight lifting, or resistance training. Lastly, take progress pictures. Progress pics are a great way to see how your body is changing, and it is a testament to how hard you are working.\nStop making excuses:\nIf you have nightmares about your weight when your sleeping, and you can\u2019t stand the way you look when you\u2019re awake then its time to start making better choices. If you don\u2019t like what you see in the mirror then you have to do something about it. So, instead of covering up what you don\u2019t like with an over-sized hoodie, reaching for the half pint of Ben & Jerry\u2019s in the fridge and telling yourself you will start fresh on Monday, START NOW!! Put down the ice cream, and have a little faith in yourself. Everyone has to start somewhere. Tis the season to be jolly, not frumpy. If you don\u2019t know where to start, YouTube it. There are so many how-to videos when it comes to exercise. A total body workout can be done at home in your living room. Also check into your local gyms. Some gyms offer free day passes, and free personal training to new members.\nA muffin a day won\u2019t make the muffin top go away:\nIn order to maintain a healthy weight you have to commit to a healthy life style. Don\u2019t fall victim to a new diet fad, because there is no such thing as a quick fix. You can\u2019t ask Santa for a six-pack, unless its coming from a liquor store. The best way to make your Christmas wish of tight abs come true is to create a routine that allows you to incorporate exercise, and healthy meal choices into your life every day. Carve out time to meal prep. When your meals, and snacks are already planned out you are less likely to be hungry, and reach for the first thing you see. A healthy lunch that may consist of chicken, brown rice and vegetables will sustain your hunger for a much longer period of time than a glazed doughnut, or chocolate chip muffin. A balanced lunch will also provide you with the energy you need to dash through the mall crowds, and score the best deals.\nContinue to push yourself:\nA new years resolution shouldn\u2019t end mid February. Once you\u2019ve reached your goal don\u2019t quit. Falling back to old habits will lead to falling back into extra-large sweat pants, and over sized t-shirts. Maintain your routine, but don\u2019t deprive yourself. You can be naughty every once in a while, order dessert, and still manage to stay on the nice list. Don\u2019t make a New Year\u2019s resolution, make a lifelong resolution. Try to be good all year, because Santa is watching.\nTo change your body you have to change your mindset.

See our services below for more information.\nIf you lose power to your sump pump, water can leak into your basement, leading to catastrophic results. Top Gun recommends installing a battery backup system or a generator for your home to enhance your basement waterproofing system.\nA battery backup will prevent flooding if your sump pump loses power. It is an affordable way to prevent extra damage and cost from the repair or flood damage and water removal.\nPrimary sump pumps can fail for many reasons including power failure, a blown fuse, or a clogged intake pipe. The older a sump pump is the more likely it is to run into problems. If your sump pump is ten years or older, consider replacing it. Strong storms can result in power outages which will render your sump pump useless. If these types of storms occur annually in your area, a battery backup will save you money and put your mind at ease.\nOver the past few years, battery backups have advanced significantly. Today they can even provide early warning for danger or when maintenance is required. Some model even have the ability to text or email you when a problem arises.\nMost battery backups are designed to provide power for four to six hours after power is lost as a result of a storm.\nBasements by nature promote dampness which is much heavier than other rooms in the house due to natural conditions or where air conditioning may not reach. Installing a basement dehumidifier will help in maintaining an ideal relative humidity level (RH Level) and provide benefits such as, help with preventing mold and mildew, eliminating musty odors, protect your family\u2019s health and assist with bringing a basement up to \u201cabove grade\u201d standards.\nHow does it work? When air enters the dehumidifier, a fan forces air over cold coils to remove moisture and drier air is blown into the basement or crawl space.\nTo solve moisture and water problems in basements, before waterproofing any walls or applying any\ninsulation, you should install drain footings around the house and study the gutters and downspouts. Make sure that roof gutters (on your house\u2019s eaves) and the downspouts are working properly. They should be well cleared and opened: otherwise, rainwater would sit on the roof and run down the walls damaging the building and your foundation.\nA basement drainage system is an efficient way to control rainwater penetration through foundation walls and to prevent moisture and condensation problems in basements. We offer many different varieties of Basement Drainage Systems to fit your individual needs. They different types are:\nCove Base \u2013 used to hug a wall and channel water from the wall into a sub-floor drainage system. Used with the Water Trek Aqua Route System.\nCurtain Drain \u2013 designed to eliminate water from entering the basement due to exterior pooling. It routes the threatening water to the side of the home away from the flooded area.\nFloor Grate \u2013 used to catch and diver water from the exterior of the bulkhead or driveway and route it to the interior subfloor system.\nWater Trek Aqua Route \u2013 an interior sub-floor system.\nChances are if you are reading this, you have experienced a water leak in your basement and you are looking for a licensed and insured contractor to help resolve your issue. The first step is to identify which options will work best for your basement.\nDetermining the Issue\nBefore we can recommend a solution, we have to identify the source of the moisture issue in your basement. The fact is that after 10 to 15 years, basements start to take on moisture. As many as 60 percent of basements will be wet during this timeframe and as many as 33 percent will experience mold and mildew issues due their environment. The moisture can be the result of condensation or could be caused by cracks in the foundation. The first indicator is typically a musty smell that most people can associate with basements. If your basement is finished and a necessary sealant wasn\u2019t applied, the moisture will become trapped and can lead to mold and mildew growth.\nType of Sealants\nPolysiloxane Blend Basement Sealant\nThis sealant bonds directly to the substrate to create a naturally water repellant surface. This type of sealer will repel any moisture and stop the growth of algae, mold and mildew. However,polysiloxane sealers still allow gases and vapor through and the surface cannot be painted. This means as an interior sealant, this choice doesn\u2019t typically last as long as other options.\nAnother drawback is these sealants will only permeate about \u00be inches into the concrete, leaving much of the foundation unprotected. However, the sealant is UV resistant and typically has a long lifespan when applied properly.\nSilicate Basement Sealants\nSilicate basement sealants can penetrate into the concrete by as much as four inches. The way this type of sealer works is it reacts to the alkalis and lime naturally found in cement, creating a permanent seal. This seal will eliminate any cracks in the concrete, as well as strengthen it and reduce any cracks that may develop in the future.\nThe good news is silicate sealants protect concrete from water vapor, water and radon gas. They will also reduce the development of condensation and protect against the growth of mildew, mold and fungi. When a silicate basement sealer is used, the basement walls will hold up against high water pressure, regardless of where it comes from. The downside to this sealant is it has a high chance of failing after just a few years, requiring reapplication.\nA silicate basement sealant should be applied before painting. It is even recommended for curing fresh concrete or for hardening the surface. Silicate basement sealants can be used in the home, as well as on outside surfaces like concrete, limestone, stucco, porous brick and other cementitious material.\nA crawl space (as the name implies) is a type of basement in which, one typically cannot stand up in and the and the bottom surface is often soil. While a crawl space cannot be used as living space, it can be used as storage. Care must be taken in doing so, as water from the damp ground, plumbing leaks and moisture seeping through porous concrete can create a perfect environment for mold/mildew to form on any surface in the crawl space, especially cardboard boxes, wood, drywall and some types of insulation.\nIn Colorado, most homes with crawl spaces are constructed with the HVAC vent lines running from the furnace through the crawl space to their desired location. These HVAC runs are not airtight and pick up and distribute everything and anything in the crawl space, throughout the home, significantly deteriorating the AIR QUALITY in the home. Furthermore, without some sort of effective vapor barrier, the only thing between a homeowner and the unknowns of a crawl space is the floor material separating the two. Crawlspace Encapsulation Benefits include:\n- Protection from moisture and improves air quality\n- Eliminates mold and odors\n- Creates useable storage\nHealth and safety issues must be considered when a home includes a crawl space. As air warms in a home, it rises and departs through the upper regions of the house, much in the same way that air moves through a chimney. This phenomenon, called the \u201cstack effect,\u201d causes the home to suck air up from the crawl space into the main area of the home. Mold spores, foul odors, fecal material from dust mites or other pests, and RADON GAS can come up with the air, aggravating breathing problems (such as asthma) and creating a variety of health-related problems.\nIf you have an issue, call Top Gun Restoration, we offer many different water proofing products and services to the area.

Just before 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, 26 March, the fire siren sounded, waking up the city\u2019s populace. Fire Chief Henry Millecam heard the alarm and was the first on the seen of the burning church. Firemen were unable to save the building but as firemen rushed into the building they were able to rescue a grand piano, along with other items. The building was completely destroyed. Work began immediately on plans for a new chapel made from mountain-red pressed brick. The structure was rebuilt in the same location, using part of the old foundation. The cornerstone was laid on Pioneer Day, 24 July 1933. Many organizations helped raise funds for the new church. One fund raiser, a rodeo, earned over $813 for the chapel construction. Church President, Heber J. Grant, dedicated the new chapel on 31 March 1934. This Church building was torn down in 1977 to make way for the new edition to the hospital.\nVernal Express Newspaper\nB&W Copy Negative and Print\nUintah County Library Regional History Center\nDigital Image,copyright 2003 Uintah County Library", "probabilities": 0.003997906111180782}
