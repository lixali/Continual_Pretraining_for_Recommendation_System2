Hopefully just one; the same number required to screw a couple AudioBulbs, a new LED light and speaker system from GiiNii International, into a couple lamps or light fixtures. Once paired with an AudioBulb base station (pictured above), which doubles as an iPod dock, you have a complete wireless audio system with minimum setup time.\nThe AudioBulb system, which will retail for $300 and include two AudioBulbs and a base station, was unveiled at the recent Pepcom press-only Holiday Spectacular event in New York. Up to eight AudioBulbs can be controlled with a base station, which has a standard 30-pin iPodconnector as well as a 3.5mm input jack for audio from other sources. Additional AudioBulbs are $100 each.\nThe 5-watt LED in each AudioBulb offers the same illumination as a 60-watt incandescent bulb and will last for about 10 years or 30,000 hours of use, according to GiiNii. The wireless audio system can be configured into two zones so that brightness and volume can be adjusted for different parts of a system. For example, the audio volume and LED brightness can be kept low in bedrooms while music plays louder and the lamps burn brighter elsewhere.\nThe wireless system has a range of 50 to 100 feet from the base station, which can be controlled with an included remote control. The AudioBulb system will ship in October but can be pre-ordered now from Amazon.\nLike this?

Featuring a wide loop of springy stainless steel aircraft cable, the Tailer slips easily over the tail of your fish, and with a quick upward pull, closes instantly and snugly. With its tail out of the water, the fish's movements are strictly limited, so it becomes much easier to tag and release the fish, or to lift it into the boat. A swivel built into the cable allows you to better handle fish that roll and twist, which sharks frequently do. The AFTCO Fish Tailer is four feet long with an aluminum shaft anodized a rich gold for lasting beauty and resistance to corrosion.

The minimum point thickness that\u2019s advocated is 0.2millimeters (0.00787 inch or 0.57 tip ), how to manufacture a product it will fall under that, the\u2019wall potency\u2019 of the portion of the stamp is compromised and might become twisted. Having said this, you can convert an image with fine lines to a suited to postage making.\nComputer apps utilize image data in several of various ways, such as apps like CorelDraw assist Vector pictures (lines) and Bitmap images (pixels), CorelDraw can be the preferred app for making rubber stamps from pictures.\nWhen scanning a drawing to your computer it will load being a bit map image, (a little like a photograph in a newspaper). This can be delivered directly to some postage manufacturer so long because it\u2019s a grayscale scan and also the line thicknesses don\u2019t fall below the minimum. When the lines are too narrow it is possible to convert the bit map image into vector data by employing a hint into the image. Programs that have tracing ability put a vector line around the lines or are placed to follow these lines, these lines may have a depth applied to produce them suitable for rubberstamp making.\nComplex drawing and illustrations can be made to rubber stamps; those might well not comprise many lines and seem like photographs. It is best to send a few different options of these to your postage manufacturer; one option is to raise the brightness of this image then convert the bit map to a simple grayscale image. Here it\u2019s ideal to pick a rubber stamp manufacturer that is familiar with one of these types of images, see below hints.\nAll images that enter your personal computer have an expansion relating to that which format they are in. You might get an image in the scan, either a clipart disc or downloaded from your clip-art service. Several are .eps along with .wmf files (Vector lineup format more common for logos or line drawings) and many others jpeg that an .gif (Bitmap pixel photos and illustrations)\nBoth image formats can produce exemplary stamps; however simple images are always best in .eps and .wmf format to allow one to readily command line depth at the event the traces are too thin.\nOnline Clip-art Services\nThere are lots of internet clipart services which offer exceptional clip art for rubber stamping; the most useful images are from services which are subscription-based which bill a yearly or per image fee. When it does not suit and you also truly wish to conserve money you should find out which service your rubberstamp manufacturer belongs to, it costs nothing to search through the clip art service he belongs into because he will be the person downloading the images. This piece of lateral thinking and choosing the ideal manufacturer will help save you lots of money as you\u2019ll not ever be required to spend money on the clip art. Clipart.com is one of the best services that some manufacturers donate to; I guess that over 3 million images at Clipart.com are acceptable for postage creation plus they are fine with manufacturers employing the images for rubberstamps.\nThe craft stamp industry is very large indeed and many folks remain buying stamps that are massproduced simply because they don\u2019t understand just how exactly to find yourself a\u2019tailor made\u2019 postage manufactured. So if you are in to card making or scrapbooking and want to find that\u2019special postage\u2019 you should find yourself a manufacturer, it is irrelevant where they\u2019re on the planet since unmounted Estimates are thin and lightweight and will be submitted easily.\nA network of postage manufacturers that offer stamps created from online clip art services are available on the web, at [http://www.stampsearch.com.au] various manufacturers will make unmounted stamps from clipart or your artwork and send the finished stamps anywhere on the planet.", "probabilities": 0.0010895660379901528}

{"id": "<urn:uuid:985d4f81-af69-4a1b-a2dd-2b9b068bb9dd>", "text": "Lemmy Koopa (known as Hip Koopa in the cartoons) is one of the Koopalings, a clan of seven siblings that act as leaders of the Koopa Troop under Bowser (originally considered his children). Lemmy is the smallest of the group, and is often associated with childish traits due to his stature and personality. He is well recognized for his multicolored mohawk, crossed-eyes, and the rubber ball he balances atop in most appearances; his special abilities also deal with bouncy balls. Lemmy is named after Lemmy Kilmister, the founder of the heavy metal band Mot\u00f6rhead.\nSuper Mario series\nSuper Mario Bros. 3\nLemmy debuts in Super Mario Bros. 3, where he and the other Koopalings aid Bowser in his conquest of the various realms of the Mushroom World. Lemmy takes over Ice Land, stealing the magic wand of its king and turning him into either a seal (NES version) or a Monty Mole (All Stars and Super Mario Advance 4 versions) in the process.\nLemmy is found and battled in the cabin of his airship at the end of World 6. He rides a rubber ball around during battle, and uses his wand to summon additional balls; once summoned, they do not disappear. The balls are obstacles and can be jumped on, but will shrink Mario or Luigi or make them lose a life if they are touched in any other way. When jumped on and withdrawing into his shell, Lemmy stays on his ball instead of jumping around. Being stomped three times defeats Lemmy, allowing Mario to return the magic wand to its king, and also turning the king back to normal.\nIn the Nintendo Power guide for Super Mario Bros. 3, Lemmy is nicknamed the \"Clown Prince of Koopas,\" a likely reference to one of the nicknames for Batman's archnemesis, the Joker (the \"Clown Prince of Crime\"), itself a pun on the term for the heir apparent of monarchies (\"Crown Prince\").\nSuper Mario World\nLemmy next appears in Super Mario World, aiding in Bowser's invasion of Dinosaur Land. He takes hold in his castle, found within the Vanilla Dome; Lemmy's is the third castle on the map. Inside, he guards one of the Yoshis trapped inside an enchanted Yoshi Egg.\nIn battle, Lemmy pops out of Warp Pipes to attack, along with two Lemmy dummies; he sometimes pops out sideways or bottom-first. Lemmy and the dummies need to be avoided except for stomping; a Zigzag Lava Bubble needs to be avoided, as well. After getting stomped three times, Lemmy is defeated and forced out of a Warp Pipe into the lava below.\nAfter being defeated, Mario smashes Lemmy's castle to bits with a hammer.\nNew Super Mario Bros. Wii\nAlong with the rest of the Koopalings, Lemmy reappears in New Super Mario Bros. Wii. With Bowser Jr.'s lead, they pop out of Princess Peach's birthday cake and use it to capture and take her away. Lemmy is the third Koopaling to be fought, just like in Super Mario World and Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga. Like in Super Mario Bros. 3, his world has an ice theme. An icy ground is also prominent in his boss fight (in which he also rides a ball), making movement difficult due to the slipperiness. His shell is now bright orange instead of green.\nLemmy is first fought at the end of World 3's tower. He uses his wand to summon balls and bounce them towards the player; they can be jumped on for boosts, but are obstacles, otherwise. Unlike in Super Mario Bros. 3, the balls will not shrink Mario or Luigi or make them lose a life if touched in any other way besides jumping on them. If the player fails to stomp Lemmy after he summons two balls, he will ride his ball to the other side of the stage, creating the hazard of being pushed off. The ice terrain makes the drops on each side of the stage extra hazardous. The first two times Lemmy is stomped, his ball falls off the stage and he spins in his shell to the opposite side of the platform, where he creates another ball to stand on. The spinning shell inflicts damage when touched. Third stomp defeats Lemmy, who quickly gets up and escapes to the world's castle.\nThere, Magikoopa uses his magic to greatly increase the size of Lemmy's ball. Lemmy summons more balls even faster, and the player must now use them to stomp Lemmy. The large ball can also be used as a boost but inflicts damage if not approached properly. If the player fails to stomp Lemmy after he summons four balls, he will bounce his ball to the other side of the stage, creating the hazard of being crushed. Once stomped twice, Lemmy's already huge ball will grow again, making for a more difficult approach. Once stomped three times, he is defeated, this time falling off the stage.\nNew Super Mario Bros. 2\nIn New Super Mario Bros. 2, Lemmy and the Koopalings arrive to kidnap Princess Peach shortly after the events of New Super Mario Bros.. Riding in the Koopa Clown Car, the Koopalings kidnap Peach from her castle, nearly crushing Mario and Luigi as they go. He is the sixth Koopaling to be fought, just like in Super Mario Bros. 3.\nLemmy is fought at the end of World Flower's castle. This battle is similar to his first encounter in New Super Mario Bros. Wii. The stage is now a conveyor-belt, however, and on the ceiling is a button that switches its direction. If the conveyor is going in the direction towards Lemmy after he summons three balls, he will change the direction by summoning another ball that hits the switch. After three stomps, Lemmy is defeated and falls off the stage.\nLemmy rejoins the other Koopalings near the end of Bowser's Castle in World 6 (and in World Star to Dry Bowser). In the Koopa Clown Car again, they try to petrify the player by flashing the vehicle's lights. Once the player reaches the corridor to the exit-door, they retreat. After Bowser's initial defeat, they use their magic to make him grow larger, much like Magikoopa in New Super Mario Bros. Wii. As he jumps up in his new state, he ends up knocking them down in the process. During the credits, they can be seen trying to lift Bowser up to safety, but they all get weighed down by him. Lemmy is last seen sprawled out on top of a flipped Koopa Clown Car.\nNew Super Mario Bros. U / New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe\nLemmy appears once again in the Wii U game New Super Mario Bros. U and its Nintendo Switch port, getting his own customized airship like the rest of the Koopalings. He is the castle boss of Acorn Plains and thus, the first Koopaling to be fought. When Mario enters his airship from Lemmy's Swingback Castle, Lemmy gets shocked once again. Due to the lack of his magic wand, he now generates bombs with his bare hands, and tosses them at Mario in the style of his bouncing balls. However, he still retains his method of ramming into Mario and friends with his circus ball. Like Wendy, Morton, and Roy, Lemmy's boss battle will involve him using a weapon instead of a magic wand. After being stomped twice, he will start throwing larger bombs. After three stomps on the head, he will be defeated and fall off stage. If the player used Boost Mode and touched the bombs on the Wii U GamePad's screen just as Lemmy was about to throw them, Lemmy will be caught in the resulting explosion, yet will still behave as if he was throwing them. He ultimately survived this, however, and ended up getting picked up by Bowser Jr. He is last seen in the closing cutscene, hanging on to Bowser's tail after the airship crashes. Of note is when he attempted to board the airship, Lemmy fell off and grabbed Bowser's tail.\nLemmy has an airship with his face as the bow and his orange shell as the deck. The tail of the ship resembles his ponytail. The stern of his ship has a teal color design, similar to his shell color from Super Mario All-Stars. Like most of the airships, Lemmy's airship is equipped with a propeller at the back of his ship as well as another one placed just beneath the crow's nest. The airship is equipped with two cannons, one on each side. There are also light green lids on top of the cannons used for closing and opening the cannons. He has the smallest airship out of all his siblings. The interior of his ship has spiral shaped windows and it resembles the inside of a circus tent.\nIn his official artwork, Lemmy has a bomb in his left hand, but in-game, he has it in his right hand. This is also the case with Roy and his Bill Blaster.\nNew Super Luigi U\nSuper Mario Advance series\nSuper Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2\nLemmy appears in Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2 to reprise his role in Super Mario World. Aside from minor textual and graphical changes, the only thing new for Lemmy was the addition of a growl.\nSuper Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3\nIn Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3, the Game Boy Advance remake of Super Mario Bros. 3, Lemmy reprises his role. In this version, he turns the Ice Land king into a Monty Mole instead of a seal. His role was also expanded slightly with the Japanese-only e-Reader level \"Hik\u014dsen wa Tomaranai!\" The level is merely a more difficult reworking of the original airship, with the player having to collect four Advance Coins before battling Lemmy. It's stated Lemmy rigged the Bolt Lifts for this level himself, however.\nIn The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World cartoons, Lemmy is referred to as Hip Koopa and often hangs out and pulls pranks with his brother Hop Koopa, whom he is twins with. Hip and Hop are considered among the youngest Koopa kids, and (according to behind-the-scenes material) are six-year-olds, while the rest of the Koopa kids are in their teens. In spite of their ages, Hip and Hop prove to be capable of doing such things as carjacking and pickpocketing. Like many stereotypical twins, Hop and Hip often share their sentences by either speaking in unison or finishing each other's lines. In the cartoons, Hip retains Lemmy's personality from the games, but his appearance is much different. He has thinner hair than Lemmy, a large overbite, one spike on his shell, lacks the stripes on the left side of his head, and does not appear to have a lazy eye. Also, his ball is a normal beach ball, whereas it has a star pattern in the games. His voice is commonly and mistakenly attributed to Tara Strong (at the time known as Tara Charendoff), who also voiced his twin brother. However, according to The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons, Hip is voiced by Stuart Stone.\nSuper Mario World: Mario to Yoshi no B\u014dken Land\nLemmy appeared in the interactive Anime adaptation of Super Mario World. Like in the game, he was fought at Vanilla Dome. He disabled a bridge and utilized switches of differing colors in an attempt at deterring Mario from crossing over. However, Mario deduced how to cross over, with his being knocked away effortlessly. He was later seen on Chocolate Island along with Ludwig, Larry, Wendy, Roy and Morton.\nNintendo Comics System\nLemmy also appeared in the Nintendo Comics System, and out of all the Koopalings, appeared the most times in the imprint. He was depicted with low intelligence, using too many bombs to blow up a pipe when trying to help Bowser blow up the Mushroom Kingdom's main water pipes in \"The Buddy System\". Ironically, Lemmy was the only one who could understand Larry's picture-only dialogue. He is also a big fan of Dirk Drain-Head.\nNintendo Adventure Books\nIn Leaping Lizards, Lemmy and five of his siblings compete in the International Mushroom Games. If Mario, Luigi and Princess Toadstool are chosen by the reader as the offensive line in the Beetlebowl event, Lemmy catches a Hoopster, only to lose it immediately afterward when Spike, a member of the opposing Sneaks team, attacks him with an exploding watermelon.\nIn Koopa Capers, Lemmy and his brothers have their wands stolen by Wendy, who disappears with them shortly afterward, intent on overthrowing their father with her own army, and a super wand she plans to create by fusing her own wand with her brothers'. If Luigi, who had been coerced by Bowser into searching for Wendy, tracks the female Koopaling down to her hideout, Bowser and the male Koopalings, who had been following him, will barge in after the plumber, but decide to stave off punishing Wendy for her mutiny if she helps search for the hiding Luigi. If Luigi had acquired Boom Boom's socks earlier in his adventure, he can toss them into Wendy's simmering wand combination potion, which will release fumes that knock the entire Koopa family and their minions out for at least a week.\nWhite Knuckle Scorin' comic\nLemmy also had a prominent role in the White Knuckle Scorin' comic. When Princess Toadstool reads a story to the Koopalings, Lemmy says \"I like learning stuff\", to which Morton replies \"Don't let pop hear you say that! He's into ignorance! Forget everything!\". Bowser, being illiterate, gets Lemmy's help reading a spell for him, which Lemmy eagerly agrees to do as he wants to show off the reading skills that he learned from Princess Toadstool. However, Bowser had chosen the wrong spell, which \"transformed the entire countryside into a medieval motif\", Mario and Luigi became knights in armor, and Yoshi became a \"mighty charger\". Later, Lemmy helps the good guys by telling them to attack Bowser by throwing Mechakoopas at his head.\nMario is Missing!\nThough Lemmy doesn't appear in Mario is Missing!, he appears in some of the official artwork. In the original DOS release of the game, a portrait of him appears above a door on Wendy's floor, among four other Koopalings. In addition, audio files designated for Lemmy can be found unused within the CD-ROM Deluxe version, hinting that he was originally going to be encountered in the game itself. Said clips are voiced by Bruce Sandig. The cover for the CD-ROM version of the game features Lemmy.\nSuper Mario Adventures\nLemmy was also featured in the Super Mario Adventures comic. Here, he aided Bowser in his plot to marry Princess Toadstool. He first appears with his brothers, watching Ludwig play a videogame and cheering for him. After Bowser interrupted their game and scolded them, Lemmy says the princess is safely behind bars, only to find out she's missing. He is given surprisingly much spotlight in the comic, along with Wendy.\nIn his battle against Mario and Yoshi, Lemmy rides in a large mech resembling a humanoid Koopa Clown Car equipped with five cannons. After sustaining heavy damage from Mario's Super Scope, Lemmy loses the use of his center cannon and begins to hop around the battlefield; eventually, after being damaged some more, Lemmy's mech explodes, flinging the Koopaling over the horizon.\nIn Hotel Mario, the Koopalings aid Bowser in his plot to steal away Princess Peach and hide her in several Koopa hotels in the Mushroom Kingdom. After Larry is defeated by Mario and Luigi and his hotel explodes, Princess Peach is flung into the clouds and into Lemmy's High-ate Regency Hotel, where Lemmy takes possession of her.\nLemmy is fought in Lemmy's Sky-Hideout, and attacks Mario by throwing paper planes at him while flying to different floors using a helicopter pack. He is one of three Koopalings who doesn't try to eat Mario or Luigi, possibly due to using a unique flying machine rather than walking about the stage. Like with any other stage Lemmy is defeated once all the doors in the stage are closed. Once Princess Peach is rescued, Lemmy attempts to chase after her, Mario and Luigi, only to be blown away with his hotel by a large fan activated by Mario.\nMario & Luigi series\nMario & Luigi: Superstar Saga / Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions\nAfter several years of absence, Lemmy makes a return appearance in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga. After hijacking Bowser's Castle and using it to attack Beanbean Castle Town, Bowletta employed the Koopalings to guard the various halls of the castle. As with most of his appearances, he is the third Koopaling to be faced.\nWhen first encountered by Mario and Luigi, Lemmy tries to confuse them by disguising Goombas as himself; in order to engage in battle with Lemmy, Mario or Luigi would need to hit him, not a copy, with their hammer.\nOnce in battle, Lemmy attacks by creating more Goomba copies of himself and shooting fireballs at Mario and Luigi (along with all the other Koopalings). In the Japanese version, he can also spin, like Iggy, Ludwig, and Larry.\nDefeating Lemmy activates a water fountain, allowing the Mario Bros. to put out the flames blocking their path and proceed towards Ludwig.\nLemmy appears in the remake Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions with the same role as before and added dialogue. Instead of disguising Goombas as clones of himself, his clones are now conjured from his wand. He will also spin around, switching positions with his clones every turn. He now shoots fireballs in two different ways: by creating a big fireball with his clones, or by shooting a smaller fireball at the bro he points at, while his clones do the same. As a side note, his eyes only cross temporarily after he finishes spinning, before focusing.\nHe also appears in the added on alternate story mode Minion Quest: The Search for Bowser as a Ranged-type ally. Lemmy first appears on the Hoohoo Mountain where he and Ludwig try to find Bowser together after Fawful attacked the flying Koopa Cruiser and made it explode. Later, he and the other Koopalings get brainwashed by Fawful and try to conquer the Beanbean Kingdom afterwards. Lemmy is requited after the player defeats him in Bowser's Castle.\nMario & Luigi: Paper Jam\nLemmy reappears in Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam. He is first seen with Morton, Iggy and King Bob-omb on top of Mount Brrr, where they shower the land with new enemies and terrain with the help of cannons. In Bowser's Castle, Lemmy, alongside Morton, commands the Papercraft King Boo, which they use to battle Mario & co., but are soon quickly defeated. Later on in Neo Bowser Castle, after Mario and co. create the bridge leading to the Bowsers, he appears at the end of the bridge arguing with Iggy on who gets to push the button to summon a large cannon that is aimed at Peach's Castle. Lemmy is then encountered one final time on top of Neo Bowser Castle, along with the rest of the Koopalings, where he is fought alongside Morton and Iggy. In his battle, Lemmy runs away, but quickly appears from the background riding on top of a large circus ball, which he uses to try to crush the Mario Bros. Mario and Luigi would need to aim and throw the boomerang directly at Lemmy a couple of times to cause him to fall and get rolled over by his own ball. Lemmy will then get dizzy and remains this way until it is his turn to attack again. After the Mario gang defeats the last remaining Koopalings, Lemmy utters some last words, telling Bowser and Paper Bowser to avenge them before exploding.\nWhen idle in battle, Lemmy can be seen playing the air guitar, referencing his namesake, Lemmy Kilmister.\nMario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey\nAlong with the other Koopalings, Lemmy appears in the game's new side story. He does not initially accompany Bowser Jr. or the other Koopalings to find a cure for the blorbs, as he elected to stay behind at Bowser's Castle to \"hold down the fort.\" However, as the castle fell under Fawful's control, Lemmy ended up being beaten up by Dieter, with Larry and Wendy witnessing this before rousting him and trying to escape. Unfortunately, they weren't able to make it far before all three were trapped in barrels, although both he and Larry escaped in the chaos caused by Bowser's Castle relocating itself and Bowser growing giant to battle the castle. Lemmy and Larry later attempted to aid Bowser when he got squished by the Tower of Yikk, although this put them in even more danger after Bowser became giant-sized. Despite this, they still foolishly tried to aid Bowser despite him not even being aware of their presence (with Lemmy in particular partly being motivated by his misinterpreting Kamek's warning to them about their actions as his insulting him for his size), forcing Bowser Jr. to go after them and later risk his life to save them. After this event, both Larry and Lemmy join Bowser Jr.'s side. During the ending, Lemmy and Bowser Jr. do a balancing act via his trademark ball and a blorbified Goomba, respectively, during the festivities celebrating the defeat of Fawful's forces.\nMario Kart series\nMario Kart 8 / Mario Kart 8 Deluxe\nLemmy Koopa, alongside the rest of the Koopalings, appears as a playable character for the first time in Mario Kart 8, where he is an unlockable character. This time, he is voiced by Carlee McManus. His nickname in a Japanese Nintendo Direct for Mario Kart 8 is \uff62\u3059\u3070\u3057\u3063\u3053\u3055\u30ca\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\uff11\u300d, or \"Number 1 in Agility\" (localized as the \"Ace of Speed\" or \"Mr. Agility Supreme\"). His emblem is a yellow silhouette of his head on a black background, similar to Bowser's emblem. Lemmy does not seem to have a lazy eye in this game, a first for any of his prior appearances.\nLemmy is the lightest member of the Koopalings (and is also among the lightest playable characters in the game, being tied with the babies and, when short in height, Miis), and as such, can get, depending on the combination, either maximum acceleration, handling, or traction attributes. However, his speed and weight are quite low as a result. Lemmy is the Normal Staff Ghost for Sherbet Land. There are also advertisements for Lemmy's Tire Service on some of the tracks.\nLemmy's main color for his Standard parts and Pipe Frame is light blue, and his secondary color is his signature orange. The color scheme selection of his other vehicle bodies is close to that of the Light Green Miis, expect for his blue Biddybuggy and brown GLA. Strangely, despite his orange shell color, Lemmy's Circuit Special and Sport Bike use the green varnish color.\nMario Kart Tour\nSuper Smash Bros. series\nSuper Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U\nLemmy (alongside the other Koopalings) makes his Super Smash Bros. debut as a playable character accessible via Bowser Jr.'s alternate costumes in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. He is unlockable in the former game and available from the start in the latter. His attacks and statistics are identical to Bowser Jr.'s, though he is referred to by his own name by the announcer and has his own voice clips. Lemmy can also appear in place of Bowser Jr. in All-Star mode (like the other Koopalings).\nLike the other Koopalings, he is actually driving a mass-produced version of the Junior Clown Car (as noted by the yellow light bulbs that serve as its eyes). The rim and propeller of his Junior Clown Car are colored yellow (his signature color). Interestingly, when the Clown Car Dash special move is used, the exhaust pipes that appear behind Lemmy's Clown Car are colored orange. He also reuses his voice clips from his appearance in New Super Mario Bros. Wii, thus he is voiced by Lani Minella.\nHe also has unique eye animations compared to the other Koopalings and Bowser Jr.; for example, when he is dizzy, his pupils move around in circles instead of having the same dizzy animation as the others.\nAn interesting oddity to note is that Lemmy's trophy in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS shows his Clown Car with an orange rim and propeller for unknown reasons.\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nIn Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Lemmy (alongside the other Koopalings) returns as a playable character accessible via Bowser Jr.'s alternate costumes. He is once again an unlockable character, like in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS. Just like in the previous game, his attacks and statistics are identical to Bowser Jr.'s, though he is referred to by his own name by the announcer and has his own voice clips. Unlike in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U, all seven Koopalings (Lemmy included) now use their magic wands for any occasion where Bowser Jr. would use his hammer. These occasions include all corresponding attacks, their side taunt, and one of their victory poses.\nPuzzle & Dragons: Super Mario Bros. Edition\nLemmy appears in Puzzle & Dragons: Super Mario Bros. Edition as a Dark attribute character, and as the World 2-Castle and World 2-Airship Boss. Like in Super Mario World, he is the boss of an underground world. He can perform a move called Status Barrier that protects against all status defects. He also has an attack called Blind Attack, which deals damage and hides a part of the board from the player's sight as well. Lemmy will join the player when \u2605World 2-Airship is completed. His Skill is Lemmy's Nightmare, which changes Wood Orbs into Dark Orbs, and Heart Orbs into Fire Orbs.\nPaper Mario: Color Splash\nLemmy makes his Paper Mario series debut in Paper Mario: Color Splash. He appears in The Emerald Circus, where he is seen balancing on a giant ball. He then hides himself and the green Big Paint Star on the circus tent's roof (as despite being a skilled illusionist, the Green Big Paint Star was immune to his wand and his magical abilities, thus forcing him to pull a \"sleight of hand.\"). After Mario defeats his minions, they encounter him on the roof, where the battle is fought. In battle, Lemmy spawns Ptooies, Juggler Bros, and Circus Bros, to aid him by using his wand. He also uses his wand to make Mario's cards disappear. He attacks by ramming Mario with his ball, although he can also use this as a feint for a magical blast attack from his wand. Hammer attacks are ineffective against him. Finally, he is capable of dodging attacks from Thing Cards. Instead, it requires that Mario distracts him with the Disco Ball Thing Card, and then using an Ice Pick Thing Card to pop his ball. If just the Ice Pick is used, Lemmy avoids the attack. If just the Disco Ball is used, Lemmy initially gets distracted, then resumes attacking after Mario finishes attacking. If Mario doesn't defeat Lemmy while he has his Wonder Ball out, Lemmy will use the Wonder Ballistic attack. Lemmy hits Mario 15 times, each dealing 10 damage each and then jumps on him dealing 13 damage, for a total of 163.\nLemmy is one of the three Koopalings that doesn't have an attack that can defeat Mario instantly when Mario has full health, even if he doesn't block them at all, the others being Morton Koopa Jr. and Roy Koopa. He's also one of the two bosses in this game that cannot be defeated with Thing Cards alone, the other being Ludwig von Koopa. The player must use regular battle cards to damage him in the first phase of the fight.\nLemmy's introductory pose is based on his artwork used in the Encyclopedia Super Mario Bros. and in material released for the 30th anniversary of Super Mario Bros., while his appearance follows that of the current games, with an additional cyan-colored tuft on the back and orange stripes on the left side of the head instead of the right side. The sprite has actually an horizontally flipped version of said pose that is then flipped again by the game. Lemmy's pose when he extract his Magic wand is instead derived from his artwork in Super Mario Bros. 3, with the mouth now being slightly open, the right hand now holding the wand more tightly and left hand showing the palm to the viewer.\nSuper Scope 6\nIn the LazerBlazer - Type A: Intercept mode in the game Super Scope 6, Lemmy can occasionally be seen flying across the game screen chasing Mario while riding a missile. Shooting Lemmy recovers a missed shot or gives bonus points in 2-player mode.\nSuper Princess Peach\nLemmy was originally going to appear in Super Princess Peach, although he was taken out of the final game with the rest of the Koopalings. According to his sprite sheet, it seems he would spit something at Princess Peach.\nIn the Super Mario Mash-Up Pack in Minecraft, Lemmy Koopa appears as a playable skin along with the rest of the Koopalings.\nLemmy is included (along with the other Koopalings) as a Boss in the Boss Deck of Monopoly Gamer. He is the sixth Boss in the deck.\nMario Tennis Aces\nLemmy has the same yellow and tan skin complexion, as well as a green oval-shaped head, that is disproportionately large compared to his small body and features a distinctive pair of orange bars on the left-side and a multi-colored mohawk, that goes from yellow, magenta, cyan, yellow, magenta, to cyan, and ends in a long yellow ponytail that fades to a more orange hue at the tip. He has large, oval eyes that are often crossed or even pointing in opposite directions, although since Mario Kart 8, it has been shown that he normally keeps his eyes correctly aligned. He's the only Koopaling with visible eyes to lack colored irises. He was shown to have teeth and eyelids in Super Mario World as well as in a short comic in the Super Mario Complete Encyclopedia, a book published by Shogakukan and written in cooperation with Nintendo, but both features have not appeared in the subsequently released games. Lemmy is the smallest of all Koopalings, around as small as Toad, as even early official material showed. His shell is orange with yellow circles around the spikes. He wears the same spiked metal cuffs as his male siblings. He also has a three-ribbed plated belly and padded feet with claws on his toes which are more pointed than those of the other Koopalings.\nIn his hand-drawn artwork of the redesigned version, he lacks the last blue tuft of the mohawk and the orange stripes are on the right side of his head. In his sprites of Super Mario World the stripes are on both sides of his head. In both remakes of Super Mario Bros. 3, the sprites show an orange mohawk, that is completely white in Super Mario World. In sprites of Super Mario World his shell is yellow despite the existence of a more appropriate palette (the green Koopa's palette), which would match the green color of his shell shown in the artwork of said game. Lemmy's Super Mario Bros. 3 sprite has the same palette as Bowser's sprite.\nIn the Super Smash Bros. series, Lemmy's appearance is unaltered, compared to the other Mario characters, including Bowser. In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, however, Lemmy receives a slightly darker and subdued color scheme, while his hair, spikes, and shell receive simple detailing, though his scales remain undefined. These traits are shared with Bowser Jr. and the other Koopalings.\nLemmy has not changed much in design since his first preliminary sketches. His sketch made during Bowser's first redesign showed him in a pose similar to the one used for his artwork in Super Mario World, with the physical appearance alredy having all the major traits of Lemmy, including the lazy eye, the mohawk, the peculiar mouth and even the spikeless cuffs, ultimately presenting only minor differences with respect to the aforementioned artwork. Said differences includes bigger nostrils, a more curved mouth, as well as a taller brow. The tips of the mohawk also had a slightly different shape.\nWhile said mohawk was always shown as having six tips, its coloring changed over time. Originally, the colors went from magenta to blue, magenta again, yellow and then green. Since the North American manual of Super Mario World, the second magenta streak was instead colored orange, with the Nintendo Power guide for the game still using the old coloring in the artwork. In the Nintendo Official Guidebook of Super Mario Collection (Japanese name of Super Mario All-Stars) Lemmy's hair was shown with only three streaks: a magenta one, followed by a cyan one and a yellow one, this coloring was reused in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga and in his unused sprites for Super Princess Peach. In his newest design this latter order was kept, but starting with a yellow stripe, and three stripes having the same order were added, along with the addition of a yellow ponytail that blends into orange at the tip. Furthermore, each tip has its own color, and his 3D models, as well as Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam, show the mohawk as being formed by six separated strands, each with its own color.\nIn Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, beside the coloring of the mohawk seen in the Nintendo Official Guidebook of Super Mario Collection, Lemmy was also given cuffs with spikes, that his previous cuffs lacked much like those of Bowser Jr..\nWith his redesign in New Super Mario Bros. Wii, like the Koopalings who had green shells, Lemmy's was given a unique color, orange. Aside from its spikes being updated to an off-white color they were also given yellow rings. The color of the two stripes on the left side of his head was also changed from pink to orange, possibly to match his shell color. Furthermore, his snout was also shortened and his artwork as well as hand-drawn illustrations started to show his tail, which previously was shown exclusively in the sprites of the games.\nPersonality and traits\nLemmy is depicted as an immature, fun-loving child, and is said to retain a childlike innocence about him. Lemmy is also known as the \"Clown Prince of Koopas\", and would apparently prefer to join the circus rather than commit crimes and conquest. He is already somewhat clownish in how he loves balancing on top of his rubber ball. His love for the circus is also mirrored in New Super Mario Bros. U, as the interior of his airship resembles the inside of a circus tent and in Paper Mario: Color Splash, where he first appeared as the ringleader of the Emerald Circus. His childish and clownish traits are also evident in Mario Kart 8, where some of his stunts have him performing a hand stand on the handle of his bike or ATV, or jumping out of his kart and flailing his arms in excitement. When losing the race, he is seen crying while kicking his feet in frustration. He seems to have a passion for the cold and ice as he was the ruler of Ice Land, as well as guardian of World 3 of New Super Mario Bros. Wii. He also seems to like dancing as shown in Paper Mario: Color Splash. He tends to rely on tricks and gadgets rather than his own prowess, such as his helicopter pack from Hotel Mario. As of New Super Mario Bros. Wii, he is shown to have a squeaky, high-pitched voice. In the original Super Mario Bros. 3 manual, Lemmy also spoke in a manner similar to that of a young child. In an interview with Dayvv Brooks, it was revealed that Lemmy was named after Lemmy Kilmister because \"he struck me as being the kind of character who would do his own thing, no matter what anyone else thought. I think it was those crazy eyes.\" In Mario Kart 8, he also has banners called \"Lemmy's Tire Service\", which implies that, besides the circus, he also has an interest in automobile repairs.\nIn Super Mario-Kun, Lemmy is silly and childish, just like in the games. However, unlike the games where he is loyal to Bowser, Lemmy willingly betrayed him in volume 44, due to the fact that he and Mario ended up becoming friends at the end of volume 41. The Koopaling even went as far as telling Mario the secret to Bowser's defeat and supplying the group with Fire Flowers. Though it seemed like Lemmy forgot about the friendship in volume 47 (with him happily greeting Mario before throwing a barrage of bombs at the beginning of the chapter), Lemmy assured Mario in the end that he had not forgetten the events from last time and they remained on good terms with each other.\nIn The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World, Hip is more mischievous than truly evil on most occasions, and preferred to simply play pranks instead of cause havoc; though several episodes, such as \"Life's Ruff\", showed him capable of causing real chaos.\nIn the Nintendo Comics System, Lemmy was somewhat childish and unintelligent, and seemed more keen on simply helping his father and trying to gain his appreciation then actually causing evil. The unintelligent aspect of his character in the Nintendo Comics System was such that when Bowser read the Koopalings the riot act in Bowser Knows Best for their letting Peach escape due to the latter tricking them, Bowser specifically exempted Lemmy from blame specifically because Bowser knew Lemmy was \"a blithering idiot.\" Like Mario and several of Bowser's minions, Lemmy also had an obsession with the plumbing based hero Dirk Drain-Head and could somehow understand Larry's picture-only dialogue, while no one else could at all. In Nintendo Adventure Books, a continuation of Nintendo Comics System, Lemmy was portrayed as somewhat crazed in demeanor and much more menacing on some occasions.\nIn the Super Mario Adventures comics, Lemmy's personality was, more or less, identical to those of the other Koopalings, with no real differentiating quirks or attributes.\nIn the computer version of Mario is Missing!, the unused voices of Lemmy depicted him as being sarcastic, as he \"pretends\" to make Luigi join them. Bowser's Inside Story also indicates that Lemmy has a bit of a napoleon complex, as when Bowser Jr. and Kamek try to convince him against aiding Bowser in defeating the Tower of Yikk, he accuses them of saying he's too short.\nPowers and abilities\nLemmy seems to prefer using circus balls when combating his enemies. He often fights atop his ball and if his boss area has icy floors or a conveyor belt, he will use them to his advantage by trying to slide his opponents right off the edges. In Super Mario Bros. 3, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, and New Super Mario Bros. 2, Lemmy utilizes his magic wand to generate rubber circus balls, in numbers up to three (even more in his New Super Mario Bros. Wii rematch), creating great difficulty for the Mario Bros.. He also utilized various dummies as decoys when fighting Mario in Super Mario World. In Hotel Mario he flies with assistance of a propeller and throws paper planes.\nIn Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, he would spin like a top like Iggy, and he could also summon Goombas disguised as clones of himself, just like Wendy. In addition, in a similar manner to Super Mario World, he also attempted in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga to confuse the Mario Bros. by splitting into copies prior to fighting them. Other than that, his abilities seem normal compared to his siblings, as he is seen walking and jumping in his Super Princess Peach sprites, and breathing fireballs in his appearance in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, as well as spinning inside his shell for offensive and defensive purposes in New Super Mario Bros. Wii. In New Super Mario Bros. U, he also threw star-patterned bombs that bounce on the floor and once touched by Mario, a short fuse is activated that will cause the bombs to explode after a few seconds.\nAs evidenced in New Super Mario Bros. Wii and New Super Mario Bros. 2, Lemmy has enhanced balance and acrobatics support, by being able to maintain his balance on a ball while on an icy floor and conveyor belt, as well as performing a handstand on the ball upon the said floors before preceding to battle. Lemmy is also implied to be quite strong, especially for someone his size, since in New Super Mario Bros. U, he's able to throw several large bombs at the Mario Bros. with minimum effort, as well as being able to lift his entire weight with one hand, as mentioned earlier.\nIn Paper Mario: Color Splash, Lemmy shows (and describes himself as having) magical prowess. He can create illusions with his magic and has the ability to teleport in puffs of magic smoke. He is shown for the first time to be able to create the standard magic blasts (colored green) his brothers can make, as well as a variant spell that doesn't directly hurt Mario, but can make his battle cards completely disappear. His other attacks involve rapidly grinding his circus ball against Mario, spawning enemies to assist him during the fight, and transforming his wand into a circus ball rimmed with spikes across the middle (referred to as a \"Wonder Ball\" by Lemmy), hitting Mario with the spinning spikes.\nProfiles and statistics\nSuper Mario Bros. 3 Nintendo Power Strategy Guide\nBio from The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 Writers Bible\nWhile the rest of the Koopalings are in their teens, Hip and Hop are bratty six-year-olds. These twins don't go anywhere without one another, and are always finishing each other's sentences. Silly and dumb, goofy and bumbling, they are always lost, and have probably forgotten where they were going anyway. They flunked Koopergarten. They wouldn't be a threat to the Marios and the princess, if it weren't for the fact that they have the most powerful Magic Wands, and are easily manipulated by Bully and their other siblings.\nIn Land 3 he Attacks by Manipulating Balls\nIt's Whack-a-Mole!
