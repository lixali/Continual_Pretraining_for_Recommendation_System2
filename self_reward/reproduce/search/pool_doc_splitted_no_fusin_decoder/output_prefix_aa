{"id": "<urn:uuid:c3811c40-d393-48a3-a4ef-da3a2b32522a>", "text": "Otto Greule Jr\nThe NFC South; home to two despicable rivals, one finalist on \"Who Wants to play in Los Angeles?\" and our very own Carolina Panthers. This division is known for parity, maybe more so than any other in the NFL. From 2003 to 2009 (excluding '08) the last place team from the prior year won the division the following year. It should also be noted that all four teams in the Dirty, Dirty South have accomplished this feat.\nIn the past decade three of the four teams from the NFC South have played in the Super Bowl. The Bucs following the 2002 season, next the Panthers following the 2003 season and finally the Saints following thousands of dollars in bounty payouts and ending the careers of Kurt Warner and Brett Favre. The Panthers were the only NFCS team who didn't finish though, falling to the Patriots 29 - 32. In the past decade we have also seen a team from the NFCS represent our division in 7 of the 10 NFC Championship games. Pretty impressive if you ask me.\nIn 2012 we saw no hint that the NFC South would be changing anytime soon. The Panthers started off slow with a 2-8 record ultimately winning 5 of their final 6 games to end the season with a 7-9 record. The Saints had a similar 2012 storyline. Starting off with an 0-4 record, they briefly willed themselves out of the stank bayou of sub.500'dom until, alas, the Panthers gave them a reality check in week 17 to end their season at 7-9. The Bucs followed a different path under their new coach, Rock 'em Sock 'em Schiano, or as the Giants offensive line know him \"Captain Kneebuster\". They started off hot with a 6-4 record including two wins against the Panthers. It seemed the OT win against the Panthers took everything out of this upstart team though as they lost the next 5 games straight, including a 41-0 shutout courtesy of the Saints. Mon dieu! They finished on a somewhat high note, defeating the Falcons who wrapped up a first round bye and home field advantage throughout the week before in Detroit. That meant a 3-way tie for second place in the division with three teams at 7-9. Finally the Falcons. This past season may have been their greatest ever. Starting off 8-0 it seemed there was no stopping them. With an aerial attack and weapons that would make Kurt Warner circa 2001 jealous, this team seemed poised to finally get over the hump, and they did! Finally Melty Ice and the coach Falcons fans call Smitty (gag) won their first playoff game! Do you know what was on the other side of that hump? ANOTHER DAMN HUMP! The Falcons ultimately lost in the NFC Championship game. Which brings us to this moment, right here.\nWhat now? Well, the three way tie led to a cluster of NFC South picks in the middle of the first round. The Bucs (13), Panthers (14) and Saints (15) will weigh options of trading back as these spots are somewhere between \"can't miss\" and \"solid starter\" while the Falcons actually have a first round pick, remember they gave up last years for Quintorris Lopez \"Julio\" Jones. What? That's his name. The Falcons are buried at 30, their consolation prize for an \"almost\" season. Do they trade up? We know they're not against it if a sure fire prospect is waiting in the wings. I think the only safe bet is that none of these teams will spend a high pick on a QB or a K.\nThere are going to be some farewells to be had in the offseason as well. Since Marty Hurney had about as much fiscal responsibility as a crackhead with a $20 bill the Panthers find themselves tapped out and then some. We potentially could see any number of players shown the door including, but not limited to Chris Gamble, Jon Beason, James Anderson, Dwan Edwards, Jordan Gross, DeAngelo Williams and a few lesser known contributors. Sigh. Well, we're not the only team that may lose a weapon or two.\nThe ageless Tony Gonzales has all but made his retirement announcement.That's one man I won't be sad to see fumbling and bumbling through a sports segment audition in the coming months. That's what you do when you retire from football, right? I remember when John Abraham used to make me cringe. Going into his 14th year he's lost more than a step and may be a casualty. There are rumors that Tyson Clabo needs to restructure to stay. Michael Turner is on the chopping block as well and Dunta Robinson doesn't appear to be safe either. Room has to be made for emerging stars and it seems the older Dirty Birds may be set free.\nThe Bucs FA list looks like a list of \"has beens\" and \"never weres\". Ronder Barber may or may not be getting dribbled down the field by Jonathan Stewart in year 17 while Dallas Clark and Jeremy Trueblood will likely be allowed to walk. I don't see much decline in talent for this group. In fact, I see a team on the upswing and their fans need to see it too. How about selling out a game there Tampa?\nAnd finally the Saints. Man I can't stand the Saints. I can't stand reading about the Saints. In fact, I really don't care enough about this group of rule breakers and thugs to research their FA situation. Blah, blah, blah Breesus, blah blah boo dat, blah derp.\nAnd finally welcome back Sean Payton! After a year in\nrehab for Vicodin addiction suspension, Payton returns to pick up where he left off. The Saints also fired Spags for fielding statistically the worst defense in the history of the National Football League. So how do you make a soap opera villain of a franchise even more of a laughing stock? Enter Rob Ryan. It's not confirmed yet but all rumors point to Ryan being the DC in New Orleans next year. Talk swirled after the loss in the NFC Championship of the Falcons canning Mike Smith but it turned out to be just that, talk. I don't know how much longer he'll be safe with that level of talent falling flat when they're needed most. But hey, he's miles ahead of Bobby Petrino.\nSo what happens in 2013? Well, the season opener is quite a ways away. Teams will change drastically and insane predictions will be had by all. In the NFC South four fanbases will strongly believe their team wins the division and beyond. With the talent level and history of the division I can't really say I blame any of us. Unfortunately for three of them it will not come to pass. One thing will remain constant though. This division is the most talented in the NFL. 70% of the time the NFC road to the Super Bowl passes through the South. I just hope this year that road is South Mint Street.\nAs is tradition in the NFC South, which crazy outcome do you see happening in 2013?\n2012: 3 way tie for 2nd. 2013: 4 way tie for 1st.

{"id": "<urn:uuid:b3c5ba3f-1abe-4356-acb7-4a2157172012>", "text": "According to legend, in 1918, a high school basketball player laced up his first pair of Converse All-Stars; Converse's first basketball shoe, released only one year previous. At that point, basketball itself was only 27 years old, and the formation of the NBA was 28 years away. Being a professional basketball player involved barnstorming-- joining a locally based traveling team and touring the country playing loosely-organized exhibition matches for small crowds. This high school player, 17 year-old Charles H. Taylor, would go on to a brief and largely unrecorded career as a barnstormer. Fifty years later, this early player and fan of both basketball and Converse All-Star sneakers would be inducted into the basketball hall of fame; not for his success as a player, but as a shoe salesman.\nBy the time Chuck Taylor joined Converse in 1921, the company was already an established footwear manufacturer, but still fairly new to the concept of athletic shoes. Founded in Malden, Massachusetts in 1908 by Marquis M. Converse, the Converse Rubber Shoe Company initially found success producing rubber-soled winter footwear, manufacturing up to 4,000 pairs per day by 1910. They were designed to prevent slipping on an icy sidewalk, but were certainly no pop-culture icons. In 1915, the company added a tennis shoe to the product line, and two years later released the not-yet famous All-Star basketball shoe.

{"id": "<urn:uuid:3c325aa1-5479-40e0-b74c-aa88c1505091>", "text": "According to legend, in 1918, a high school basketball player laced up his first pair of Converse All-Stars; Converse's first basketball shoe, released only one year previous. At that point, basketball itself was only 27 years old, and the formation of the NBA was 28 years away. Being a professional basketball player involved barnstorming-- joining a locally based traveling team and touring the country playing loosely-organized exhibition matches for small crowds. This high school player, 17 year-old Charles H. Taylor, would go on to a brief and largely unrecorded career as a barnstormer. Fifty years later, this early player and fan of both basketball and Converse All-Star sneakers would be inducted into the basketball hall of fame; not for his success as a player, but as a shoe salesman.\nBy the time Chuck Taylor joined Converse in 1921, the company was already an established footwear manufacturer, but still fairly new to the concept of athletic shoes. Founded in Malden, Massachusetts in 1908 by Marquis M. Converse, the Converse Rubber Shoe Company initially found success producing rubber-soled winter footwear, manufacturing up to 4,000 pairs per day by 1910. They were designed to prevent slipping on an icy sidewalk, but were certainly no pop-culture icons. In 1915, the company added a tennis shoe to the product line, and two years later released the not-yet famous All-Star basketball shoe. It was this shoe, of course, which Chuck Taylor (according to legend, anyway) improved in 1921 by suggesting a more flexible outsole and the shoe's signature supportive ankle patch. After he'd spent two years touring the country promoting the newly improved All-Star and the still-fledgling sport of basketball, Converse added Chuck's actual signature to the shoe's patch.

{"id": "<urn:uuid:93a9ec14-9f89-4bc6-b2e4-f218fdae662a>", "text": "Art and Iconography\nGILDING; GOLD LEAF OVER RED CLAY BOLE\nPREPARING RED CLAY BOLE (pronounced \"bowl\") - or buy prepared liquid bole.\n- Prepare liquid bole in advance. This is a messy job, so wear an apron, and protect your counter top, or else\n- Bole is finely ground clay or earth, consisting of tiny pieces of stone mixed with animal skin glue. It sinks in\nwater, and can clog drains. Select an outdoor location to discard wash water.\n- The binder for liquid bole is animal-skin glue. Without glue binder, bole will not stick properly to the board.\n- Tools: You will need a large dedicated porcelain mortar and pestle, 2 or more nesting fine-mesh strainers plus\noptional piece of nylon panty hose, 2 large (soup size) spoons, a piece of slick-surfaced white cardboard such\nas shirt cardboard, a large-mouth container with a secure lid, and a dish pan partially filled with water.\n- To make enough liquid bole for 2 to 4 icons, mix one heaping spoonful of paste bole with one flat spoonful of\nliquid hide glue, using mortar and pestle. (Some iconographers use dried powdered bole.) Add a small amount\nof warm water, working the mixture as smooth as possible, to the consistency of heavy cream. Let it sit a few\nminutes so coarser grains will settle to the bottom.\n- Strain the mixture into its wide-mouth container. Use a spoon to scrape the liquid bole through two or more\nnested fine-mesh strainers. For smoother bole, line strainer with a piece of nylon panty hose.\n- Apply a test sample to shirt cardboard, and let it dry completely. Test by scraping with fingernail. Clay should\nshow a light scratch mark. If clay can be scraped off easily, there is not enough glue. If the surface is overly\nglossy and no mark is made, more paste bole is needed.\n- If necessary, return the mixture to the mortar, add glue or paste bole as required, and repeat the process.\n- When you are satisfied, place lid tightly onto container of liquid bole, put mixing tools into dish pan, and clean\nup. Discard waste water outdoors, not down the sink drain! Clay bole can clog sink drains.\nAPPLYING GOLD LEAF\n- Gilding is highly sensitive to temperature and humidity. If\npossible, gild early on a cool morning, when condensation forms on car\nwindshields. Gilding can be difficult In warm or dry weather. Put your\nicon in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes. A large heavy board may\nrequire more fridge time. The cooling should help the moisture in your\nbreath condense on the clay bole. If gold leaf sticks to the white gesso,\nthe board may be too cold.\n- Now breathe closely on your icon, on the burnished bole where you want\nto gild, using warm moist breath from the bottom of your lungs. Light\ncondensation should form on the spot where you breathe.\n- Quickly lay the gold leaf on the selected spot of polished bole, gold side\ndown and wax paper on top. Lay a square of rouge paper over it. Press\nand rub gently but firmly with fingers and/or a soft wide brush.\n- The condensation from your breath should cause the gold leaf to\nadhere to the bole.\n- When the wax paper is removed, some gold leaf may extend past the\nedge of the halo area. Don't brush it away! Use your soft brush to move\nit carefully back onto the halo, and press down with the brush.\n- Use \"scraps\" of gold leaf, still sitting loosely on wax paper, to fill in gaps.\nIf there are small gaps where gold leaf won't stick, mix 2 drops of liquid\ngum Arabic (from watercolor section of art supply store) with 2 drops\nwater, and paint lightly on the spot before applying gold leaf. Vodka can\nbe used similarly. After several attempts at gilding with the same gold\nleaf, it will not come off of the wax paper.\n- Save bits of loose gold leaf in a small lidded container, such as a small\nplastic yogurt container, to be used later for shell gold.\n- Repeat gilding for at least 2 layers of gold leaf. The second layer may\nbe applied immediately after the first. Using a dry, soft, wide brush,\nbrush the freshly applied gold in a radial pattern, center to edge, to\nsoften irregularities. The gold will take on a smooth satin sheen.\n- Gold leaf is soft and \"touchy\" when first applied. In an hour or two, after\nthe gold leaf has stiffened, you can burnish all or part of it - in which\ncase any defects, bumps, bubbles, or low places in the bole under\nburnished gold leaf will be visible. I prefer to leave it satin gold, or to\nimpress a design - often a very simple design such as a row of dots.\n- If the bole under your gold is exquisitely level and smooth (as mine\nusually isn't), you can burnish the entire halo to a high gloss. Work\nlightly, running the stone burnisher radially, center to edge of halo.\nPREPARING GOLD LEAF\n- Gold leaf comes in books of 25 sheets, separated by orange \"rouge paper\"\nwhich does not stick to gold. Buy 23 or 24 carat \"water gilding\" or \"surface\"\ngold leaf - not \"patent\" gold leaf. \"Double\" weight is preferred.\n- When working with gold leaf, close doors and windows to eliminate drafts.\nTurn off incandescent desk lamps; the heat may warm your icon.\n- Cut ordinary wax paper into squares slightly larger than the gold leaf. When\nyou are ready for gilding, carefully open the book of gold leaf, quickly lay\ndown a piece of wax paper centered on the gold, and rub lightly all over.\n- The gold leaf should stick to the wax paper. Use dedicated sharp scissors\nto cut the assembly into 6 to 8 pieces, each with a \"tail\" of wax paper for\nhandling. Rectangular or slightly wedged-shaped pieces may be used to fill\nin a halo in a radial pattern. Or you may prefer to cut the edge of the gold\nleaf to fit the curve of the halo.\n- Immediately return remaining gold leaf to its envelope. Do not pick up\nanother sheet of gold leaf until you have finished applying the first sheet.\nAPPLYING LIQUID BOLE TO YOUR ICON\n- On your icon, lightly mark the edge of the halo, using a compass with pencil tip. The halo should be centered\non the head, around eyebrow level. (On many icon drawings, the center of the halo is marked with an X.)\nLeave at least 3/8 inch (10mm) between the top of the halo and the edge of the board. See layout page.\nOptional: Engrave lightly around area to be gilded - around edge of halo, and between the figure and its halo.\n- Draw a light pencil guide line around the perimeter of your icon board, a scant 1/8 inch (2 to 3mm) from the\nedge of the board.\n- (Here's a suggestion I haven't tried yet; prime-paint areas to be gilded, using 15 drops vodka to one drop hide\nglue. Let it dry before applying bole. This is supposed to reduce bubbles in the bole.)\n- If using paste bole prepared according to instructions above - In your palette cup, put a few drops of\nwater. Coat a No. 2 round brush with honey, about half-way up the brush, and mix the honey into the water.\nNow mix in liquid bole, and stir well. Later, the honey will help the gold leaf adhere to the dried and\nburnished bole, even in dry weather.\n- Stir your bole mix slowly and gently, so as not to form bubbles in it. Your bole mix should be very smooth, the\nconsistency of heavy cream. If it seems at all gritty, let the grit settle to the bottom, and use the top layer for\nareas to be gilded. Add another drop or two of water to be bole in the palette if needed.\n- If using prepared liquid bole - Stir well, to mix the liquid at the top with the heavy material at the bottom of\nthe jar. Spoon or pour some bole into your palette cup. Coat a No. 2 round brush with honey, about half-way\nup the brush, and mix the honey into the liquid bole. The prepared bole is quite fluid and usually requires no\nadditional water. (Prepared liquid bole makes a nice smooth surface for gilding; but tends to run down vertical\nsurfaces like the sides of the board, and diagonal surfaces like the slope at the edge of the recess or kovcheg.\nI like to have both liquid and paste bole available for these different uses; or better yet to mix them.)\n- Optional for experienced iconographers: Once you have mastered the ruling pen, you can fill it with liquid\nbole and use it to neatly define the edge of the halo.\n- Starting in one corner and keeping a wet edge, apply liquid bole to the halo area. Holding your brush at an\nangle to the surface, mop on evenly and carefully with a fairly full brush, using small circular brush\nstrokes. Do not use long straight brush strokes! Do not dab! Your brush should barely touch the\nsurface of the board, but should not leave the board until the brush needs to be refilled. Liquid\nbole should form a thick puddle and level off smooth and flat under its own surface tension. White\nsurface should not show through bole. Immediately add more bole to any thin spots. You should not need a\nsecond coat. One of my students has compared this process to applying icing on top of a cake, without letting\nthe spreader touch the cake. This thick puddle of bole will usually take an hour or longer to dry.\n- Bubbles in bole can be a problem. If bubbles develop in the bole puddle, gently work them out with your brush,\nor try blowing on them softly through a drinking straw.\n- Slight irregularities at the edge, where the bole meets the board, are normal. If you make a big mistake, clean it\ngently with a damp Q-tip. Do not scrub. It's OK if a slight stain remains.\n- Now paint the edges of the icon with more liquid bole; honey not required. You may want to add a little more\nglue to reduce future chipping of the edge. Raise the icon up on a support slightly smaller than the icon, such\nas a stack of plastic palettes or magazines. Use your No. 2 brush to paint in from the edge 2-3mm to the pencil\nline. Now use a large flat brush to paint the vertical edges. Long strokes are OK here. Check that no white\nspots remain! The edges usually require a second coat. Let bole dry - which may take an hour or so.\nSANDING AND BURNISHING DRIED BOLE\n- To receive gold leaf, the dry bole must be sanded and then burnished to a smooth near-mirror finish.\n- Use increasingly fine sandpaper or other sanding media to smooth out the bole; first 320 grit (if needed), then\n400 grit, then 600 and finer grit. Remove bumps and level out dents, checking occasionally under bright light\nto locate any remaining irregularities or holes in the surface. Wipe up dust with a tissue - don't blow it around.\n- Be careful not to grind all the way down to the white gesso. On a sculpted board with a recess, be cautious at\nthe edge of the recess! As long as some bole remains on the surface, gold leaf should adhere to the bole.\n- Now burnish to a sheen, using a smooth metal or hard stone burnishing tool. A tumbled hard stone, perfectly\nsmooth with no cracks or pits, also makes a good burnisher. Use firm but light pressure, just enough to\nleave a shiny track on the hardened bole. If you see grooves or dents, lighten the pressure. Many\niconographers prefer to polish with a small piece of horsehair cloth interfacing, available at some fabric stores.\n- The burnished bole may have a slight orange peel texture, especially with prepared liquid bole, indicating that\nthe clay grains are thicker than the dried liquid. In most cases this is OK; but if in doubt, make a small gilded\ntest patch. If the orange peel texture keeps gold leaf from adhering, apply a second layer of bole.\n- Burnish systematically, because the burnish marks will show through the gold leaf. Burnish radially from center\nto edges of halo, so that all burnish lines point toward the center. Also burnish around the edges, where bole\nmeets the white gesso of the board. Insofar as possible, avoid burnishing the white gesso.\n- Should you sand and burnish the bole on the edge of the board? You may if you wish, but it's optional. Like\nalmost everything in iconography, there's a symbolic meaning. The edge represents our everyday life and our\nouter persona, which are inevitably imperfect and subject to rough treatment. The inner recess (kovcheg or\n\"ark\") of a sculpted board, where the holy images appear, is like the subconscious, or a dream state, or our\ninner self. But some of the \"heavenly\" gold extends beyond this inner recess, into the bordering area.\nGold leaf applied over bole provides a slightly\nraised, attractively dimensional halo.\nAt a class or workshop, liquid bole and gold leaf are usually\navailable for classroom use. There may be an additional\ncharge for gold leaf. Although gold is always expensive, the\ngold leaf so thin you can see the light through it! It represents\nonly a small proportion of your expense for art supplies.\nIMPRESSING A DESIGN IN THE GOLD LEAF (OPTIONAL)\nThis process produces a really beautiful dimensional effect, and it\u2019s great for concealing bubbles and\ndefects in the bole \u2013 but it must be done while the gold leaf is fresh, one to 30 hours after application.\nAfter that, the gold leaf gradually stiffens. Allow 3 hours work time.\n- Use a pencil-tipped compass to lightly draw a single or double line around the perimeter of the halo, 1/8 inch\nto 3/16 inch in from the edge. This border should remain without a design.\n- Select a design. A cross in the halo indicates Christ, or a symbolic representation of Christ. An eight-pointed\nstar indicates divinity. Floral, leafy, radiating, or geometrical designs may be used for any saint, prophet, or\nangel. Use a printed pattern, use a ruler or drafting tools and templates, or work freehand.\n- Personally, I find that printed halo patterns are rarely a good fit for my icon. I prefer to make leafy or floral\npatterns freehand, directly on the gold leaf. Lightly draw a curly leaf, then another and another, until the\nspace is filled. If empty spots remain, put in a small flower, or an oval or round shape. You can find other\nideas in illustrated books and on china plates. As always when trying something new, practice on paper first.\n- If using a printed halo pattern, Xerox to slightly smaller than the size of your saint's halo. Using tracing paper\nand your paper icon pattern, adjust the design to fit your saint's halo. Tape tracing paper over the gilded\nhalo, and trace over design with ball-point pen. When paper is lifted, light lines will show on gold leaf.\nWork with care, because mistakes cannot be undone.\n- Use a round-tipped metal craft tool or a \u201cdead\u201d ball-point pen, first to make closely spaced regular\nindentations around the perimeter line, then to delineate the pattern.\n- For a floral or leafy design, stipple the background with many small indentations, and leave the designs\nwithout stippling. Optionally, parts of the design may be burnished. You have three basic textures from which\nto choose; stippled gold, satin or matte gold, and burnished gold.\n- Some designs repeat at equal intervals, in a radial pattern around the halo. Divide the halo into equal\nwedges using a protractor.\n- For larger-scale designs, hammer in impressions with small leather-working tools or nail sets.\nPicking up gold leaf on\nwax paper, and cutting into\nsmaller wedges for easier\nhandling. Always leave a\n\"tail\" of wax paper.\nBreathe on the bole with warm\nmoist breath, and immediately lay\ndown the wax paper with gold leaf.\nBrush or press into place, using\nrouge paper over the wax paper.\nWhen gilding is complete, your icon is ready for the red halo circle,\neither painted over guide lines, or applied with a ruling pen\ncompass. This will be followed by the first layers of paint, known\nas roskrish or roskrysh.\nForward to Studio Tips including use of the ruling pen\nForward to Shell Gold - applying gold leaf over paint\nBack to Home Page\nBack to Main Technical Page\nYoshi Mathias applies gold leaf over bole,\nusing a soft brush. She protects the gold\nleaf with rouge paper. Loose scraps of\ngold leaf go into the small plastic yogurt\ncontainer in the foreground.\nGOLD LEAF WILL STICK TO PAINT!\nCOMPLETE GILDING BEFORE YOU\nAfter painting, you can make minor\nrepairs to gold leaf, but patches\nwill show slightly.\nThe application of gold leaf over clay bole is full of symbolic meaning!\nThe clay symbolizes the earth from which Adam (and all humanity) was created. With\nthe gold leaf, you \"breathe life\" into the clay, as God breathed life into Adam.\nJust as raw clay is fired into a handsome and durable pot, applying gold leaf \"fires\"\nthe clay bole into luminous beauty, reflecting earthly and heavenly light.\nThe halo images the solar disc, and earthy clay is raised to a likeness of heaven.\nNOTE: Gilding is beautiful but not essential. Many historic icons have a painted halo - usually\nlight yellow, but sometimes bright red or emerald green! If you are starting off, or have difficulty\nobtaining bole and gold leaf, paint the halo instead. Coat the edge of your board with reddish\nbrown paint instead of liquid bole. Alternatively, you can use \"patent\" gold leaf applied with\nadhesive, which results in a relatively flat look and cannot be burnished. Modern adhesives\nare antithetical to the Prosopon method, which relies on use of natural materials only.\nAs you work on your design, pinholes may open up. At left, a half-completed freehand leafy design has\nexposed many spots of bole. There are 7 five-petaled flowers among the leaves - and I hammered in five closely\nspaced impressions at the center of each flower, using a small nail set. This turned out to be a technical error -\nthe gold leaf peeled off the heavily textured centers of the flowers.\nAfter the design was completed, I applied another layer of gold leaf, which covered most of the\npinholes. Then I \"stippled\" the entire halo with a soft dry brush held vertically, and the design came right\nthrough the new gold leaf. But I could not persuade the gold leaf to stick to the centers of the flowers. So, during\nthe painting of the red halo line, each flower received a spot of red paint in its center. Although the spacing is\nirregular, the effect pleases me.\nLaurence Farhat has laid\nout his icon of Christ\nEnthroned, and now it is\nready for gilding.\nOTHER METHODS OF \"WATER GILDING\" OVER BOLE - Gold leaf can be adhered to bole by first lightly\nbrushing the surface of the bole with plain water, or water with a few drops of gum arabic, or vodka.\nI have not tried any of these methods, but experimentation on practice board (not on your icon) is\nencouraged. Many of Loretta Hoffmann's icons have beautiful smooth gilded backgrounds, achieved\nby brushing vodka over the bole. She says she also uses lots of gold leaf.\nFor more information about gold leaf, and the tools and methods by which it can be applied, go to\nwww.auricgold.com. Or call Easy Leaf Products 800-569-5323.\nStart applying bole in one corner, outlining the edge of the halo\nas you go. Fill in between the edges with a wet brush held at a\nslant, to make a puddle of bole, which should level out smooth\nunder its own surface tension. If the bole on the board gets\nbumpy, add a drop of water to the bole in the palette. Keep a wet\nedge, and work fairly rapidly. Proceed until halo area is covered.\nA GILDED BACKGROUND can be gorgeous!\nMany historic icons have gilded backgrounds,\nbecause the intense brilliance of gold recalls\nthe light of heaven.\nA gilded background requires many hours of\nwork; not recommended for beginners. Wait\nuntil you are confident of your gilding skills!\nFor this 13 x 17 inch icon, I used an extra layer\nof prepared bole for additional dimensionality in\nthe halo areas. Layout, application of bole,\nsanding and polishing, and gilding took about\n15 hours. 27 sheets of gold leaf were required.\nFor a neater edge, before applying bole, engrave the lines where gold leaf will meet the white gesso.\nThis is especially helpful for the straight lines on the thick border of the board, surrounding the", "probabilities": 0.015733608976006508}
