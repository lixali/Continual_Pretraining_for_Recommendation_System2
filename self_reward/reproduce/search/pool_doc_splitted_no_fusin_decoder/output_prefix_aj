The park was established in 1934, and, with over 9 million visits per year, it is the most-visited national park in the United States.\nThe Great Smokies are part of an International Biosphere Reserve. The range is home to an estimated 187,000 acres (76,000 ha) of old growth forest, constituting the largest such stand east of the Mississippi River. The cove hardwood forests in the range's lower elevations are among the most diverse ecosystems in North America, and the Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest that coats the range's upper elevations is the largest of its kind. The Great Smokies are also home to the densest black bear population in the Eastern United States and the most diverse salamander population outside of the tropics.\nAlong with the Biosphere reserve, the Great Smokies have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The U.S. National Park Service preserves and maintains 78 structures within the national park that were once part of the numerous small Appalachian communities scattered throughout the range's river valleys and coves. The park contains five historic districts and nine individual listings on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe name \"Smoky\" comes from the natural fog that often hangs over the range and presents as large smoke plumes from a distance.

Growing up in such a beautiful part of the world inspired Ulrike\u2019s love of nature from an early age, while her family\u2019s heritage of gardening and horticulture saw her develop an in-depth understanding of plants and herbs. These childhood experiences were to have a profound impact on Ulrike\u2019s life.\nIn the 1960s, Ulrike\u2019s passion for nature led her to study horticulture and education at university. She taught for five years before marrying Juergen Klein in 1972. Together, she and Juergen founded a company, where they researched and extracted plant essences for use in food, cosmetics and paint. They created their first aromatherapy products long before aromatherapy became fashionable. And their vision \u2013 to produce a healing, plant-based skin care range using 100% pure ingredients \u2013 began to crystallise.\nIn 1983, Ulrike and Juergen\u2019s search for the perfect place to realise this vision led them and their four young children to the Adelaide Hills in South Australia. Two years later, they founded Jurlique.\nOver the next decade, Jurlique grew from these humble beginnings into a company that employed over 200 people across Australia, ran over 30 retail outlets, and exported to 18 countries.\nAs Jurlique continued to grow, Ulrike became increasingly focus on conducting the company\u2019s seminars, workshops and herb farm tours. In doing so, she inspired woman of all ages to understand that health and beauty comes from within when we radiate the beauty and inner freedom we have when we live in harmony with ourselves.\nFrom moving half way around the world and pioneering a wholly natural lifestyle, Ulrike inspires us each day.\nWant more like this in your inbox?\nSign up to our newsletter to hear more about our skincare tips, new products & special offers.", "probabilities": 0.9586462378501892}

{"id": "<urn:uuid:34f45ea0-af20-48b8-9b5b-c416e3c7ab7c>", "text": "\u2018Sound mind in a sound body\u2019; this is an old saying very relevant to students who are preparing for examination. Remember, you have put in one year of hard work for this \u2018D\u2019 day. The marks or grade you score in the examination is not just a jugglery of figures; it is a benchmark of your effort, your performance. I am telling all these not to frighten you, but only to advise you to take some simple steps so that you keep fit to effectively take on the examination and come out successfully.\nYour physical fitness\nExamination is the time when you are glued to your study table for several hours. Therefore, it is the time when you also lack physical exercises. The body requires some rejuvenation. The body cells need enough blood to function properly. So, take at least about one hour of your time for exercises. Go to the nearest park or playground or to your backyard garden. Play with your brother or sister or friend in the neighbor or at least take rigorous walk so that you sweat and in turn make the body relaxed and rejuvenated.\nKeep a tab on your food; totally give up high calorie food and junk food. Instead, switch over to food containing enough protein like fruits, nuts, vegetable salad etc. Drink enough water but reduce on beverages like tea and coffee. Remember, the food you take must supply enough protein and nutrients to your body. If you want you can even consult your physician or dietician who will guide your suitably.\nYou must have at least six hours of sound sleep. Some students are in the habit of reading during night. But according to physicians it is always advisable to sleep during night because with that the body gets maximum relaxation. If you have enough sleep you will not carry over the fatigue of the previous day and you feel fully relaxed.\nLast minute preparation always makes you tensed. Therefore if you want to remain calm during the period of examination, the simple remedy is to start studying from the day one of your school or college days. You can also take the help of your teachers who would perhaps even provide with better tips on the method of preparing for various subjects. At the same time, you can also practice yoga and meditation. That would certainly provide you the much needed mental relaxation. Certainly your anxiety level will come down.\nFor example, after every two hours of study, take a short break of about 5 to 10 minutes. Just move out of your study table and walk in your back yard garden. Some students will not agree with this method. But according to educationists, this method of taking short breaks really does wonder. You will be able to retain what all you have studied during the last two hours.\nIf you follow these simple suggestions certainly you will be able to take your examination \u2018head on\u2019 and you will also come out with great success.\nIn respect of those students who passed their Board exam for the first time in 2012, the eligibility criteria for joining any of the IITs or ISM Dhanbad will be 60% marks in their 12th Board or equivalent (55% for SC/ST/PwD candidates). For those candidates who appear in their Board exams for the first time in 2013, the eligibility criteria will remain \u2018top 20 percentile of the successful candidates\u2019 in their Boards, category-wise. This will be a one-time exception for JEE (Advanced) 2013 only.\nFor those students who passed their 12th Board exams in 2012 but are re-appearing in the 2013 Board exams with a view to improve their performance, 60% rule will apply if they use their 2012 Board exam results and \u2018top 20 percentile\u2019 rule will apply if they use their 2013 Board exam results.

Its range abuts that of Scarlet-fronted Parakeet (Aratinga wagleri); Scarlet-fronted primarily occurs at higher elevations, in moister montane forests, but occasionally the two species may be found at the same sites. Red-masked Parakeet is grass green with a solid red plumage \"mask\" covering the forecrown, crown, lores and cheeks, along with red underwing coverts and red terminal tibiotarsal (leg) feathers. Red-masked Parakeet is a social species, and usually is encountered in flocks. Its diet is not well known but includes the seeds and fruit of several different tree species and Erythrina flowers. Red-masked Parakeet formerly was very common throughout its range, but the population has declined markedly in recent decades. Its IUCN Red List status is rated as Near-Threatened, but some authorities believe that it would be more accurate to classify Red-masked Parakeet as Vulnerable.", "probabilities": 0.04629117622971535}
